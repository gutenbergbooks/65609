<p>The following Report contains a summary of investigations
of the Committee re-appointed by the British Association for
the Advancement of Science, at Southport, in 1883, to consist
of Professor Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, Mr. John
Cordeaux, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, Mr. R. M. Barrington, and
Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining (with the
consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity
House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the Commissioners
of Irish Lights) observations on the Migration of
Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and of reporting on the
same at Montreal, Canada, in 1884. Mr. Cordeaux to be the
Secretary.</p>

<p>The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by
Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown; for the East Coast of England,
by Mr. Cordeaux; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by
Mr. R. M. Barrington and Mr. A. G. More. No return has
been received by the Committee from the West Coast of
England and the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>"We had a succession of black nights going up the river, and it was observable
that whenever we landed and suddenly inundated the trees with the intense sun-burst
of the Electric Light, a certain curious effect was always produced: hundreds
of birds flocked instantly out from the masses of shining green foliage, and went
careering hither and thither through the white rays, and often a song bird turned
up and fell to singing. We judged that they mistook this superb artificial day for
the genuine article."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mark Twain</span>, in '<i>Life on the Mississippi</i>,' p. 452.</p>

<p>From Skykkesholm, in Iceland, comes our first return from
that country since the commencement of our work. M. Thorlacius,
to whom we are indebted for this return, writes as follows:&mdash;"As
this list cannot nearly comprise all the Icelandic birds of
passage, of which especially the sea-birds are wanting, I shall
complete this by next mail, and send you the continuation along
with a complete list of the appearances of birds of passage in
the present year (1883). The dates quoted opposite each species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">-2-</span>
is the day on which they were first observed here. The approximate
date of departure will be given later."</p>

<p>The following notes are copied direct from M. Thorlacius'
schedule, and are most useful to the Committee, serving as they
do as finger-posts on the route of migration, indicating the important
dates of arrival at their breeding-quarters of Icelandic
summer migrants. When M. Thorlacius sends his autumn
departures of migrants and the other good things he so kindly
promises us, we will have useful standpoints, the spaces between
which can be more easily filled in when these are fixed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faroe.</span>&mdash;From Faroe, thanks again to our friend Herr H. C.
M&uuml;ller, we have the following report, some twelve entries or so
between Jan. 1st and Sept. 10th, 1883:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Jan. 1st three Wild Swans, <i>C. musicus</i>, seen flying S. at
noon. On April 28th one <i>Gallinula chloropus</i>, Waterhen, taken
alive in Vaay in Bord&oacute;. Between May 3rd and 11th several
White Wagtails seen during N.N.E., stormy, with snow at different
localities in the islands. On May 27th two Red-necked
Phalaropes were seen on the sea near Thorshavn during S.W.
wind, moderate, with showers of rain.</p>

<p>In August White Wagtails again appeared, when several
were seen on the 21st at Thorshavn at noon, fresh W. breeze
and clear. Between Aug. 28th and Sept. 10th, Whimbrels (see
under Whimbrel, Curlew) were preparing for departure, and
disappeared on the last-named date. During this time the winds
were from N.W. on Aug. 28th by N. to N.E. on Aug. 30th to
Sept. 3rd, and W. on the 10th, the day of departure.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Herr H. C. M&uuml;ller informs me that a lighthouse will
be shortly erected at Nossoe, in Faroe, eighty feet above the sea.
Herr M&uuml;ller considers that this will prove a good station for
observing birds during migration. Suder&ouml;e would also be a good
observatory. He also told me of the occurrence, for the first
time, of <i>Sciurus noveboracensis</i> at Nordtalik, Greenland, about
May, 1882; and of the occurrence also of a young Sabine's Gull
at the same place. I have a young Sabine's Gull, brought home
last year (1883) by the whalers to Dundee.</p>

<p>Of the progress of the scheme of accumulation of migrational
data in other parts of the world, we may notice here that Dr.
Arthur proposes to take up the subject at the lighthouses in New
Zealand, and will send the Committee his schedules for arrangement.</p>

<p>Our American friends have made a promising start with
similar intentions, but of a much wider scope, as is shown by
the circular, which we here reprint, as it will show to our
reporters other collateral subjects which offer plenty of opportunity
for observation, and which can easily be made as applicable
here as in North America, as regards our commoner species.
Schedules somewhat more elaborate than ours have been issued
also to lighthouses in America:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the first congress of the American Ornithologists' Union,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">-4-</span>
held in New York City, Sept. 26th-28th, 1883, a Committee
on the Migration of Birds was appointed. It is the purpose of
this Committee to investigate in all its bearings, and to the
fullest extent possible, the subject of the migration of birds in
the United States and British North America. The work will
not be limited to the accumulation of records of the times of
arrival and departure of the different species, but will embrace
the collection of all data that may aid in determining the causes
which influence the progress of migration from season to season.
For example, severe storms, gales of wind, protracted periods of
unusually high or low temperature (for the locality and time of
year) are among the atmospheric conditions that are known to
exert marked effects upon the movements of birds. The opening
of the leaves and the flowering of certain plants, with the correlative
appearance of a multitude of insects, are also among the
factors that have to do with the abundance of many species.
Hence the careful registration of certain meteorological phenomena,
and of the state of advancing vegetation from day to
day, will constitute prominent items in the record books of the
observer.</p>

<p>"For convenience in collecting and arranging the enormous
mass of material which will be accumulated by the joint labours
of this army of field workers, it has been deemed advisable to
divide the vast expanse of territory embraced in the United
States and British North America into thirteen districts, each of
which will be placed under the immediate direction of a competent
superintendent."</p>

<p>Some time ago we received application from China for
schedules and letters of instructions, but as yet we have had
no further communication from that quarter. We would be glad
to hear of the scheme being started there also. Most of the
lighthouse-keepers there are Scotch and English.</p>

<p>The ordinary papers were sent to thirty stations on the East
Coast of Scotland, Faroe, and Iceland, as in former years.
Twelve stations on this coast have sent in forty-two schedules
out of the twenty-six E.C. stations of Scotland. All returns are
much lighter than in 1882, and this is more readily noticed when
we compare the numbers of schedules returned from our principal
stations. Thus, from Sumburgh Head we have three; from
Pentland Skerries twelve (three more than in 1882); from Bell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">-5-</span>
Rock two; and from Isle of May only ten, as against nineteen
in 1882.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8224; Mr. D. McDonald removed from Pentland Skerries to Skervuile (W. C.)
about July 26th, up to which time he sent returns from Pentland Skerries.
Thereafter Mr. J. Gilmour took in hand the returns at the latter station.</p>

<p>&#8225; I have to thank Mr. W. Davidson for the first schedule received from
Tarbat Ness. Between Aug. 15th and Oct. 30th there are only eleven
entries,' all light, of ten different dates only. This schedule is valuable for
its negative evidence, just as other more favoured localities for migrants give
valuable positive evidence. Can I not induce others to return even empty
schedules at the end of the year, with the simple remark "No Birds" or
"Few Birds" attached, if such is the case? Then our Committee would
have certainty to go by, not merely hypothesis. Mr. Davidson gives me
the further information regarding this station, that he observed no further
migration since Oct. 30th, the weather being so mild. It is usually before
any changes in the weather that we see any birds passing here besides the
birds which frequent the locality. The situation of Tarbat Ness is a very
high tower, 175 feet, and is joined to farmhouses. It is not much sheltered,
the tower being on the bare point. At some seasons great quantities of birds
are seen (<i>in lit.</i>, Jan. 20th, 1884).</p>

<p>&sect; At Chanonry lighthouse the schedule, again kindly returned by Mr.
McGill, pretty clearly indicates and illustrates the action of local migrations.
Thus he tells us:&mdash;"There are plenty of Black Crows, which fly between this
and Nairn every day for feeding in the morning, and fly back at night. A
great many grey ducks come down on this Firth for the purpose of feeding.
It would seem they do not migrate. There are several flocks of birds which
seem to fly north the one day and in a few days to fly back to the south;
they seem to be the same flocks that have been feeding." From Chanonry
Mr. McGill writes:&mdash;"Only one bird has struck the lantern since I came
here in the summer of 1882, and only two lighted on the lantern. None
killed." The returns from this station almost all relate to local movements,
but are not on this account less valuable, but rather more so, as giving good
opportunity of making comparisons and deductions. Most of the occurrences
are attended by highly developed pressures, squalls, strong breezes, &amp;c., but
the directions of these are not given.</p>

<p>&#8214; Mr. D. M. Scott, who left this station, removed to Sumburgh Head.
He sent the description of a bird from Kinnaird Head in 1882, but no
schedule. Scarcity is the true reason of lack of returns from this station.
Mr. Scott has sent well-filled schedules since from Sumburgh Head.</p>

<p>&para; "No Birds" at Montroseness, reason given for absence of returns in
1882 (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">-6-</span></p>

<p>From Kinnaird Head Lighthouse I have the following reply
to my inquiry:&mdash;"Birds at this lighthouse are every year getting
more scarce, as the town is now extended to the lighthouse, and
cooperage works at the very gate make much noise, and sparks
of fire fly about whilst making the barrels." At the same time
Mr. D. M. Scott, now at Sumburgh Head, tells me he has once
caught, in one watch, forty-eight Starlings at the lantern, and
some Thrushes.</p>

<p>I have also to thank Mr. Alexander Greig for the first return
from Noss Head. The movements of Gannets, as related there,
cannot fail to be of use to the Committee. Mr. Greig says,
"There has been great scarcity of birds this last year, except
those which are generally with us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span></p>

<p>Through Mr. Thomas Southwell's kindness I have received a
few items of interest from the log of the whaler 'Eclipse,' Capt.
D. Gray. Also a note from Mr. T. H. Nelson, taken on board the
'Camoens,' 150 miles N.N.W. of Orkney; as also a note or two,
through the kindness of Mr. Robert Gray, taken on board the
'Marathon' in the Atlantic by Mr. Thomas Anderson. These are
now given; and the land notes will be entered after the paragraphs
on each species or group.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">'Eclipse.'</span>&mdash;March 28th, 1883, 70&deg; 7&#8242; north, 3&deg; 40&#8242; west, saw
but one Hooded Seal to-day, but plenty of Rotches, Looms,
Snow Birds, and Mallemauks. April 19th, 69&deg; 53&#8242; north, 5&deg; 30&#8242;
west, saw a few Bottlenose Whales, and at night a Merlin lighted
on the fore-topsail-yard, and there fell asleep, and was afterwards
caught. He seemed very tired and weak. I made a box for him,
and fed him on small pieces of meat. April 22nd, the Hawk
seems to be thriving; he is kept below during the day and on
deck when it is fine. April 24th, 68&deg; 29' north, 9&deg; 12&#8242; west, let
the Hawk away at 10 a.m. He flew straight to S.W. At 2 p.m.
spoke the 'Catharine' brig. Whilst speaking the 'Catharine' I
was astonished to see my old friend the Hawk sitting on one leg
in the lower quarter boat, looking very disconsolate, and, when
scared, immediately flew to the 'Catharine.' He had evidently
come across that vessel at sea, and had flown on board her.
May 2nd, 68&deg; 20&#8242; north, 11&deg; 30&#8242; west, a great many birds about
the ship, a few hundreds of Mallemauks, and numerous Snow
Birds, Burgomasters, Snow Buntings, two Eider Ducks, and one
Iceland Falcon. May 4th, the vessel was followed by a good
many Mallemauks, Burgomasters, Snow Birds, &amp;c. May 18th,
69&deg; 37&#8242; north, 9&deg; 9&#8242; east, in the morning a Loom alighted on the
main-topsail-yard, and Rotches have been numerous, besides the
usual number of Mallemauks, Kittiwakes, Snow Birds, and
Burgomasters. May 22nd, 69&deg; 59&#8242; 3&deg; west, about 65 miles N.N.E.
from Jan Mayen, "a few Bottlenose Whales seen during the day,
and several Black-headed Gulls and Whimbrels." [This is an
interesting note in the distribution of the Whimbrel, which
species Capt. Gray knows well, having brought home skins before
now, all the way from the coast of S. Greenland, and others have
arrived, brought by other whalers, at least two of which are in
our collection.&mdash;J. A. H. B.] June 10th (70&deg; 32&#8242; north, 1&deg; 29&#8242;
west), a Swallow or Martin seen. May 16th (about 67&deg; 41&#8242; north,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span>
14&deg; 34&#8242; west), two birds known at home as Wheatears and Water
Wagtails ["Watee Wagtails" (<i>sic</i>) local in Forfar.&mdash;J. A. H. B.]
came on board and died. They were experiencing very heavy
weather at the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">'Marathon.'</span>&mdash;October 12th, 1883 (46&deg; 43&#8242; north, 35&deg; 39&#8242; west),
six or seven Snow Buntings flew on board, winter plumage, wind
fresh N.W., and only two remained, the others leaving to go to
another vessel passed by the 'Marathon.' The other vessel had
a deck-load of wood.&mdash;R. G.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">'Camoens.'</span>&mdash;Mr. T. H. Nelson writes:&mdash;"A friend of mine took
a trip to Iceland in the 'Camoens' last October. On Oct. 14th,
150 miles N.N.W. of Orkney, a Starling flew on board. On the
journey both there and back, <i>viz.</i>, between Oct. 18th and Dec.
3rd, a great many small birds were seen <i>flying south</i>, but my
friend was not well enough versed in Ornithology to be able to
identify them."</p>

<p>Notes are presented upon about seventeen species of water-fowl
and fifty-four species of land birds, and about thirteen
species of waders or littoral species, by our east coast reporters.</p>

<p>Spring migration having been more considerable this season,
I keep separate in this Report.</p>

<p>The movements recorded occupy the whole year, from date
of February to June, during spring, and from date of July to
January, during autumn.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p><a id="Turdidae"></a><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring a considerable migration noticed at
certain stations, <i>viz.</i>, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of
May. Began Feb. 2nd, when a rush of Song Thrushes took
place at Bell Rock, and terminated May 10th, when, and upon
the 9th, there were indications of another rush of Fieldfares and
Ring Ouzels. Whilst Song Thrushes, Redwings, and Blackbirds
seem usually to travel together, the larger-winged Fieldfares and
Eing Ouzels are usually associated in our returns, though not
invariably. Although this spring migration was spread over
such a very considerable time, none of the returns are very
heavy; but indications of rushes are sufficiently distinct. At
Bell Rock, as above stated, on Feb. 2nd, strong E.N.E., with
haze. Fieldfares and Ring Ouzels; at Isle of May, on March
2nd, light W., clear, Thrushes and Blackbirds&mdash;a decided but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
not large rush, which stopped abruptly with wind changing to
gales from S.E. to E.N.E. and to N.W. (see Third Report, General
Remarks, p. 67.&mdash;J. A. H. B.). In April, light but fairly continuous
entries at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, but little
indication of a general movement, except on April 27th, when a
good many Fieldfares and Ring Ouzels were noted at Isle of May,
wind fresh S.E. Prevailing winds up to termination of spring
migration, easterly along whole coast. On May 2nd, and again
on 9th and 10th, there were faint indications of rushes at Isle of
May, principally of Fieldfares.</p>

<p>In autumn the migration was pronounced, and confined principally
to October and November. Yet the earliest record we
have yet received in Scotland in our schedules occurred on Aug.
28th, at Isle of May, of two Song Thrushes, followed by a single
record on Sept. 21st; also at Isle of May, "a few Redwings and
Ring Ouzels." Again, passing at present over October and
November, only one record in December of a solitary Fieldfare on
the 5th; and in January, 1884, a flock on the 7th and three birds
on the 22nd, during a wild W. gale. The month of October has
many entries, and I find the word "rush" opposite the following
dates and stations:&mdash;At Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, but
not at Bell Rock, on 13th-15th, hundreds of Redwings and Ring
Ouzels, also Blackbirds and Thrushes, besides many other birds
whose names I will give later. Also at N. Unst a few stragglers
rested on the 16th, and then flew south, with strong S.E. wind
and haze. Again, from about Oct. 28th to Nov. 5th, a great
movement, developing into vast rushes, between Oct. 30th and
Nov. 3rd, on which latter day a Dipper (<i>Cinclus</i>) was seen on the
Isle of May; twice fired at for the collection, but escaped. The
stations, N. Unst, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Tarbat
Ness, Bell Rock, and Isle of May participated (maximum at Isle
of May), but also large numbers at Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock,
and goodly appearance at Sumburgh Head on Nov. 1st. On
Oct. 13th-15th wind was S., but shifted to W. at Isle of May.
On Oct. 28th and 29th wind was S., light and clear; and on 30th
to Nov. 1st still prevailing southerly and westerly. Mr. Agnew
states that the rush on 13th-15th was the largest ever witnessed
by him at Isle of May with a due S. wind, S.E. being usually the
most productive. Having detailed the movements and given
dates and circumstances of these rushes, I will now name the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span>
other species which participated in them, and refer back to this
paragraph afterwards throughout the Report. During the
October rush, 13th-15th, Redwings in hundreds; Ring Ouzels,
Bramblings, Larks, Woodcock, Short-eared Owl, Yellow Bunting,
Eider Ducks in large flocks; Chaffinches, Crows (Carrion and
Hooded), Jackdaws (the largest flock ever seen at Isle of May),
Bramblings, Tree Sparrows, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and one
Missel Thrush; besides, in smaller numbers. Wagtails, Redstarts,
Hawks, &amp;c. During the great October to November
rush the following participated: Sandpipers, Snow Buntings,
Skylarks, as far as N. Unst; and southwards. Lapwings, Grey
Crows, Robins (smaller numbers), Linnets, Chaffinches, Starlings.
At Sumburgh Head a large migration of Thrushes,
with Starlings, Larks, and Linnets; many killed. At Pentland
Skerries rush began on 20th, and also at Isle of May,
principally <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> and <i>Emberizid&aelig;</i>. At Bell Rock, on Oct.
31st&mdash;Nov. 1st, rush began at 7 a.m. Mr. Jack writes:&mdash;"Immense
numbers killed. I have no doubt they were killed in
hundreds. What we think were Woodcocks struck with great
force. Birds continued flying within the influence of the rays
of light till the first streak of day, continually striking hard all
night, and falling into the sea. Although we cannot be sure, we
think there was a great number of Woodcocks struck and fell
into the sea."<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Species of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> seven, including <i>Cinclus</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> What a loss of useful food to the lighthouse-keepers, which might perhaps
be saved to them by a few long poles and an old herring-net stretched
round and outside the balcony. This fact is surely worthy of the attention
of the Commissioners and all Directors of our Lighthouse Stations.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="Saxicolinae"></a><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring considerable arrival of at Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest (a single Stonechat
(<i>vera</i>) <i>S. rubicola</i>) on March 20th, at Isle of May, with
light E. wind and haze. [N.B.&mdash;In our Third Report, p. 8, the
first record was on 29th of Wheatear, but this record in Mr.
Agnew's schedule was entered as "Stonechat." Owing to the
confusion existing between the Wheatear and "Stonechat" it is
usually almost impossible to know to which the name Stonechat
is applied. The true Stonechat is very like a Whinchat, and in
no respect resembles the Wheatear, except in the sound of
its voice.] The next earliest was of three Redstarts (or Firetails),
on March 29th, also at Isle of May, S.E. fresh, haze.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span>
Indications of a rush of Wheatears between April 5th and 13th,
at Isle of May; and much lighter indications of single birds at
same dates at Pentland Skerries. Redstarts scarce; two on
April 27th, one on 26th at Isle of May, and a few at same place.
These in every instance with light or fresh S.E. winds in April,
and light N.E. in May.</p>

<p>In autumn a considerable migration, commencing on August
20th; first record at Isle of May&mdash;"Stonechat" [one earlier
record occurs at same place on July 14th, but it is perhaps
difficult to say to what this belongs, as Wheatears breed annually
on Isle of May]; one killed at lantern. Fresh N.W. wind, and
terminating as far as schedules indicate, by Nov. 11th. In this
statement are included Wheatears, "Stonechats," [true Stonechats
identified], Redstarts; but there are no records at any
stations of Wheatears or Stonechats between Sept. 12th and
Nov. 1st. October is, curiously enough, entirely blank of any
returns of <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i>, and there are only two records in November.
The rushes took place end of August, culminating on the
night of Sept. 2nd-3rd, when a great rush of Wheatears,
Redstarts, and also Chiffchaffs, Robins and Sedge Warblers,
Wood Warblers, and Golden and Grey Plovers took place. The
absence of any record of Thrushes or <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> at this date at
any of the stations is noteworthy. Mr. Agnew writes:&mdash;"The
night of Sept. 2nd was very stormy, wind S.E., shifting to N.E.,
with heavy rain. The birds were all in large numbers throughout
the night, except a Blue-throated Warbler, adult, which was
solitary." On the 12th, nearly all Wheatears left the Isle
of May. On the 4th, at Pentland Skerries, a rush all day with
strong N. wind and rain. Indications at Bell Rock very faint
throughout. In the vast rush of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> and other species
(see <a href="#Turdidae"><i>Turdid&aelig;</i></a> under date) of Nov. 1st, one solitary Wheatear is
first recorded, the first notice since Sept. 12th. In all three species
of <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> with certainty.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The true Wheatear, "white on the rump," is intended
in the return from Pentland Skerries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, earliest record (Robin) is March 18th,
at Pentland Skerries, and with an E.S.E. gale and sleet; and
the latest (also Robin) on May 11th, at Sumburgh Head, fresh,
S.S.E. A rush of Robins at Isle of May on April 26th, when
"large numbers" appeared; fresh, S.E. and haze. Robins disappeared
from Cromarty station on March 30th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span></p>

<p>In autumn, earliest record at Isle of May on Aug. 16th,&mdash;Whitethroat,&mdash;when
almost a rush might be recorded. On the
23rd again, at same place, large numbers of Whitethroats and
Titmice. At Cromarty station Robins reappeared, about a dozen
being seen on Sept. 15th, the first since spring. On Sept. 15th,
a rush of Robins at Isle of May, and on 22nd. Winds on
all these dates easterly, with fog, and on 15th "flying banks
of fog." Records also of Blackcap on 10th, and more Blackcaps
on 23rd; that on 10th with light W. wind, the others light E.
No records in October except at Chanonry, two on 15th, strong
squalls and S.W. Small numbers beginning of November,
amongst Thrushes, &amp;c., <i>q.v.</i> stations; Pentland Skerries, light;
Dunnet Head, one record; the latest on Dec. 28th; and
Jan. 30th, at Chanonry; light squalls and sleet. Bell Rock and
Isle of May (maximum). Blue-throated Warbler on night
of Sept. 2nd-3rd. In all three species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring a distinct movement of Goldcrests,
but nothing to compare with the autumn rush of 1882,
though comparing favourably with the spring rush of the same year.
Earliest record, April 1st, Isle of May; then singly or in small
numbers till 13th, when rather more, along with other species.
Latest date of Goldcrests or other Leaf-warblers, April 16th, at
Pentland Skerries; one Goldcrest; light N.E., clear. The first
Chiffchaff on April 26th; also at Isle of May; wind S.E. and
haze; and some again on May 2nd; and Willow Warblers and
Chiffchaffs on May 15th.</p>

<p>In autumn a rush at Isle of May and no previous records;
on Sept. 3rd (see <a href="#Saxicolinae"><i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i></a>); on the 2nd a S.E. gale, changing
light W., very dark. Scattered records running through 10th,
11th, to 15th, when another rush of Willow Warblers and Chiffchaffs,
and a solitary Goldcrest on 22nd, with a rush of Robins.
Goldcrests did not put in an appearance much before Oct. 10th,
when a rush took place that night, with light E. wind and cloudy,
again at Isle of May. Mr. D. M. Scott speaks of the "smallest
wrens he ever saw," which were seen at Sumburgh Head, on
Oct. 28th, which were probably of this species. Stations
recording are Sumburgh Head (one record); Tarbat Ness one
record on Oct. 30th [some years Caithness gets a large share
of Goldcrests]; and Isle of May. Three species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A few scattered notices in April and May at Pentland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">-13-</span>
Skerries on April 25th, 27th and 29th, with S. easterly and
N.E. wind; rain, haze or clear; and at same place on May 13th.
<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. MacDonald distinguishes between "Titmice" and
"Tomtits." Titmice are probably Cole Tits, and "Tomtits"
Blue Tits, <i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>.</p>

<p>In autumn, in September, a few at Isle of May, on 4th, 5th,
18th, 19th; on the 4th and 19th, travelling with "Stonechats";
also at Isle of May; winds westerly and northerly. In October,
one record at Inchkeith; wind light S.W., which seems the
usually chosen wind at this locality for birds migrating. In
November, on the 18th, one bird, which is either a Cole Tit or a
Great Tit, at Isle of May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;&mdash;Accentorin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A Solitary record of one
Sedge Warbler, at Isle of May, on May 17th, constitutes the
whole spring returns.</p>

<p>In autumn, only two records in all; one at Isle of May on
Sept. 12th, of one Sedge Warbler, with light S.E., haze and
rain; and the other on Oct. 11th, at same place, of a Hedge
Sparrow ("Blue Janet" of Schedule). One species of Marsh
Warblers, and one probably <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytin&aelig;</span>, Common Wren.&mdash;On April 9th, one struck
and killed (No. 66, in spirits); light W., clear!</p>

<p>In autumn, on Aug. 18th, at Sumburgh Head, a few
remained two days; light W. and haze. Wrens not in large
numbers accompanied rush of other migrants on Sept. 22nd and
23rd; fresh E. and very dark, at Isle of May. In October, one
record at N. Unst, resting at 10 a.m.; S.W., light and haze ("a
rare visitor.") It would be interesting to know if this was one
of the large-footed form found in Faroe (<i>T. Far&ouml;ensis</i>), or our
common species.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In November, a few on 7th at Isle of May;
and at Tarbat Ness, one on Oct. 27th; in November, three seen
at Sumburgh Head, with strong breeze and hailstones.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> This I hope to be able to decide next year, should any turn up at this
station.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In Spring, at Pentland Skerries and Isle
of May. Earliest, March 2nd, at Isle of May; light W., clear;
with a rush of other migrants. Five seen on March 30th&mdash;"the
most ever seen together in spring," at Isle of May, "by
Mr. Agnew;" a gale from the S. the previous night, but wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">-14-</span>
westerly when seen; these birds flying north. Other records are
with E. or S.E. winds, on 19th, 20th and 23rd. In April, two
records at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, on 3rd and 25th.</p>

<p>In autumn, records from Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock and
Isle of May. Earliest, July 13th, at the first-named station, and
again on 28th, with fresh N. wind and haze or rain. Scattered
records in August, mostly at Pentland Skerries, with northerly
winds; but two records, one with light S. and clear, and the
other, Aug. 18th, with fresh W. and cloudy, when thirteen
were counted. In September, a flock at Bell Rock on 1st; a few
on 2nd, at Pentland Skerries; a number on 11th, with Robins,
at Isle of May. In October, one record at Isle of May, on 10th,
light E., haze; and the latest record at Isle of May, one bird on
7th. The Wagtails on Oct. 10th are described as very light-coloured,
but from the good description it is easily seen that
they are immature birds of probably the Pied Wagtail. But it
is desirable to watch for <i>very light</i> or <i>light-backed birds</i> at Isle of
May and elsewhere, and especially at Bell Rock, <i>during the
spring</i> migration, as such may prove to be the continental White
Wagtail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, the Rock Pipits resident at the Isle of
May received considerable additions to their numbers on March
19th, and Meadow Pipits arrived in small numbers on 21st,
which is an early date. On April 3rd, both had much increased
in numbers. "Moss-cheepers," <i>i.e.</i>, Meadow Pipits, are also
noted at Bell Rock, on April 27th.</p>

<p>In autumn the movement was never great. Noted at Bell
Rock, and, curiously enough, <i>not</i> at Isle of May, nor at any
other stations. Duration: Aug. 9th&mdash;light S. breeze, fog, one
resting&mdash;to Nov. 1st, when one was noted along with the vast
rush of other migrants (see <a href="#Saxicolinae"><i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i></a>). Indication of the rush
very faint about Sept. 1st, when a flock rested on the Rock; a
few more seen on 16th, 19th and 22nd; winds light S.W. on 1st,
light N.W. on 22nd, and E.N.E. on 19th; calm on 16th. On
Oct. 9th also a flock flying with "Bullfinches." [These latter
may, Mr. Jack thinks, be named wrong, and may be either
Crossbills or Hawfinches.]</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;A Waxwing, <i>Ampelis garrula</i>,&mdash;a male in full
plumage,&mdash;was found at North Unst, of which Mr. Garrick
writes me that it had been kept too long and could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
unfortunately be preserved. Two very fine old Waxwings were
shot at Kinneil Woods, near Borrowstonness (or Bo'ness), by
Mr. D. Nichol, gamekeeper to Mr. Russell, Dundas Castle, on
Jan. 18th, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laniad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A male killed at Helensburgh (Dumbartonshire),
shot by Major Allan Colquhoun, Feb. 3rd, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, <i>i.e.</i>, till end of June, records reach
me from Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries and Isle
of May. (It is often difficult to draw the line in the case
of <i>Hirundinid&aelig;</i>, between spring migration, local flights, and
autumn migration. This year, however, they are tolerably
distinct, as I have no records during the whole of July). Earliest
spring record is at Sumburgh Head, on April 21st, a single bird,
and the next is at Isle of May on April 26th; winds in both
cases S.E., and two more on 28th. No more till May 14th, with
S.W. wind at Isle of May. Occasional light returns all through
May, at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May; winds easterly
at former, and westerly at latter. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;None breed at Isle of
May. No rush distinguishable. In June the dates are 5th (at
Sumburgh Head and at Pentland Skerries), Sand Martin; 10th,
four seen at Sumburgh Head, and 13th, 14th, 17th and 26th, at
different stations; winds from all directions between S.W. at
Sumburgh Head by N. to E. Swallows arrived at Cromarty on
May 13th; first seen.</p>

<p>In autumn, the movement, as far as I can judge, extended
through August and September, and lingered into October, the
latest record coming from Sumburgh Head on Oct. 6th. A
rush is indicated by the returns on Sept. 8th and 15th at Isle
of May, when "considerable numbers," "large numbers," and
on the 19th, "some," are the data. Wind light W. on 8th, and
easterly the other days. The directions of flight of Swallows
recorded in August vary considerably. Thus, at Pentland Skerries,
one Martin flying E.; strong S.E. and rain, on Aug. 8th; one
Swallow, "flying around," on 9th; fresh E., showers, and
"flying W."; on 20th light S.E. and haze. At Isle of May, five
Swallows flying S., light S.E., haze on 22nd, and flock "flying
S." on 30th; light S.E., haze. Swallows left Cromarty on
Sept. 8th; last seen.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Swallows seen by me in some numbers at
Kirkmichael House, Dumfries, on evening of April 13th, flying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
over the artificial ponds. Also seen at Morningside by A. B.
Herbert, on 15th. I have the following notes from Dr. John
Grieve, at Bridge of Allan, which locality is famed in spring for
the shelter afforded from east winds. Dr. Grieve's notes refer
however to autumn notes. In 1880 Swifts left the Bridge of
Allan on Aug. 10th. In 1879 Swifts left between 8th and 17th,
and in 1882 on the 8th. "Previous to leaving they always
chase one another round the houses until two days before
leaving; then they appear to keep to higher air." In 1881 two
were seen on May 3rd, being the first arrivals. In 1880 about
200 "Martins and a few Swallows collected on two houses in
Bridge of Allan on Aug. 22nd, and similar congregations took
place in smaller numbers on 27th to 31st, and on Sept. 8th. On
Oct. 4th, frost; and in afternoon some twenty-five seen. On
Oct. 6th, five to one hundred seen hawking over the wood behind
Bridge of Allan. On 8th, six seen. On 8th, hard frost and fog;
four seen flying about <i>in silence</i>; next morning, hard frost. On
20th, 15&deg; frost; on 21st, 6&deg;; 22nd, 10&deg;; and 23rd, 2&deg;. But on 23rd
two Swallows seen. These were the last that year." In 1882
great numbers of Swallows and Martins were seen flying eastward,
outside the cliffs of Beachy Head on Oct. 4th, and a good
many remained along the undercliff of the Isle of Wight at
Ventnor.</p>

<p>The above notes by Dr. Grieve are quite to the point, and if
we could continue to receive land notes such as these from all
parts of the country they would be sure to prove most useful,
even if confined to one or two species of regular migrants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Both in spring and autumn, one of the
features of the 1883 migration is the number of records of
Finches (also of Thrushes, and to a less extent of Buntings),
whilst Thrushes&mdash;of sorts&mdash;and Finches, seem usually to travel
together; there seems, if we may so call it, more uniform action
in the formers' movements in 1883. The Thrushes' movements
are more compressed: those of Finches more extended in time;
or, in other words, the spring and autumn migrations of the
<i>Turdid&aelig;</i> are more strongly defined than those of the Finches.
Thrushes (including Blackbirds and all species) are totally
absent during June and July (not including residents of course),
and almost absent during August and September, and again the
same in December and January (1884). But, though the migrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">-17-</span>
of the Finches are easily defined, still they do spread out
more over the whole year, and, with the exception of July,
occupy considerable space in the schedule. These remarks are
intended to apply only to 1883, not as a general statement.</p>

<p>In spring, records come from five of the stations giving
returns, <i>viz.</i>, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries,
Bell Rock and Isle of May. The earliest, two Green Linnets
at Isle of May, on Feb. 17th (the only record of that month).
Again, at Isle of May, Tree Sparrows and Chaffinches on March
2nd&mdash;single birds. Latest, June 22nd, at Pentland Skerries&mdash;four
"Linnets." These are probably Twites or else Grey
Linnets. During April, between 1st and 5th, there was a rush
of Grey Linnets with light W. wind, clear, along with other
species; and during the month there are lighter movements
recorded of the following species:&mdash;Chaffinch, Sumburgh Head;
Common Sparrow, Pentland Skerries; Green Linnets, Isle of
May; Bramblings, Tree Sparrows and Bullfinches. Wind at
Sumburgh Head light S.E., but elsewhere generally light W. and
usually clear. In May a small flock of Sparrows at Auskerry,
from the 14th to 31st; one Brambling, one Chaffinch, one Green
Linnet, between 10th and 15th, with fresh N.N.E. wind.</p>

<p>In autumn, at North Unst, one flock, Oct. 17th; S.E., light,
haze; Sumburgh Head, considerable migration in October&mdash;November
with other species (see <a href="#Turdidae">Thrush</a>). Pentland Skerries,
small indication as compared with more southerly stations;
Chanonry, light; Tarbat Ness, full migration; Bell Rock, rush;
and Isle of May, rushes. Earliest, Aug. 5th; numbers of small
flocks; wind light W. at Isle of May. Latest, Dec. 26th, at Isle
of May. Rushes:&mdash;General rush of migrants, Sept. 22nd, at
Isle of May, in which Bramblings participated; Oct. 13th, at
Tarbat Ness, Bramblings, wind due S.; also rush of same, 15th
and 16th, same place; and rush also of Tree Sparrows,
Chaffinches, "Green Buntings" (? Green Linnets), and Linnets,
at Chanonry; strong breeze and showers; movements
all through October of these same species; also Linnets
at Pentland Skerries; Siskins ("Sisting" of schedule), one
flock, old and young, on 7th, at Tarbat Ness, and again five
on Oct. 29th. Light S., haze, on 30th at Pentland Skerries&mdash;date
of principal rush,&mdash;but westerly gales at Tarbat Ness on
29th. At the time of rush between Oct. 13th and 16th, at Tarbat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
Ness, the wind began at due S.; 14th, strong S., and to noon
on 10th; then to W. and west gale at night of 15th. West
gales continued to end of month. By Nov. 1st to 3rd a vast
rush at Bell Rock and Isle of May, and also at Sumburgh
Head. By the 5th, rush all over and almost all left. Pentland
Skerries did not appear to participate largely in this rush.
The species are chiefly Chaffinches and Bramblings, also Green
Linnets, Gray Linnets and Sparrows. Prevailing winds westerly.
In December, fewer records at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May.
Winds prevailing N.W. and W. At Dunnet Head "Linnets"
are reported present all the year round. In January, 1884,
one or two light records of Brambling and Greenfinch at Isle
of May. Latest, Jan. 12th. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr. Gilmour, Pentland
Skerries, writes he was not sure of the Chaffinches at that
station, when he took up the keeping of the records, and that
they may prove to be Snow Buntings, which is very likely. Mr.
D. M. Scott, at Sumburgh Head, writes under date of Oct. 11th,
"a number of small birds killed on balcony: picked up four
Green Linnets and two Chaffinches. I discovered to-day what
becomes of them after being killed. In a hole of a stone dyke
I found a large number of wings and legs of small birds, taken
there by Weasels" (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Mustela erminea</i>, which was introduced
to Shetland. The Common Weasel, <i>Mustela vulgaris</i>, is not an
inhabitant of Shetland). If Mr. Scott would in future collect all
the wings and send them to me by post, they would be useful in
identifying species; or, at any time, if a rare bird occurs, the
name of which is not known, the wings, might be sent (see
addition to letter of instructions, issued 1884). Mr. Agnew
notes that he had never before witnessed such a large migration
at Isle of May, with a due S. wind, as that of Oct. 13th, 14th, and
15th. Chaffinch was heard singing on Feb. 28th at Dunipace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;I have records every month in the year but June.
In January, 1884, one Hooded Crow flying north, W.S.W. gale,
clear. In February, 1883, records of Grey Crows, Jackdaws (at
Isle of May, "very rare" on 13th and 14th, light S. and S.W.,
shifting to N). Rooks (at Isle of May, on. 19th, a single bird).
In March, Rooks (at Pentland Skerries a flock all day, fresh S.E.,
cloudy), and one Hooded Crow (on 19th at Isle of May, light,
S.E.). In April, at Sumburgh Head, Bell Rock, and Isle of
May, Rooks and Carrion Crows and one Hooded Crow; prevailing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
winds S.E., clear. One Black Crow flying north at Noss Head,
with light N.W. and clear. In May two records only at Sumburgh
Head on 3rd, and at Pentland Skerries, on 11th, of Rooks
(two flying W., fresh W. breeze and clear).</p>

<p>In autumn, in July, all the records are of Rooks, all at one
station, <i>viz.</i>, Pentland Skerries, and in each case birds remaining
on island all day; winds moderate N., cloudy or clear, but
strong S. on 27th. In August, Rooks again at Pentland Skerries,
on island; single birds. The above are probably merely local
predatory excursions from the mainland of Scotland. In Sept.
eighteen Ravens seen at Sumburgh Head, flying S., light N.E.
and clear. In October many more records. At Sumburgh
Head twelve to twenty Hooded Crows continually fighting with,
four large Hawks, one of which was so exhausted as nearly to
allow Mr. D. M. Scott to catch it on the ground. Many single
or other light records. The most seen, thirty Jackdaws (the
largest flock Mr. Agnew has ever seen on Isle of May), on Oct.
15th, S. to W. winds; also twenty-six Carrion Crows and a few
"Hoodies" on 31st at Isle of May. Of these sixteen came from
the north at 3 p.m., light S. and haze. In November Carrion
and Hooded Crows attended the rush of migrants on 1st, coming
from the north. On the 3rd the Isle of May was literally swarming
with birds, and on the 9th Jackdaws, two in number, reappeared;
light W., clear. In December, at Sumburgh Head,
two "large Black Crows" (Carrion Crows?), or, as the natives
call them, "Scotch Crows"; strong breeze and hail showers. A
very regular local migration of Crows or Rooks takes place day
after day past Chanonry from and to Nairn, feeding in the
morning and back at night. At Sumburgh Head Grey Crows
are seen almost daily. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Mr. R. Gray writes me
that great numbers of Hooded Crows are at present frequenting
Tyne Woods on the estate of the Earl of Haddington in East
Lothian. They came some time ago in a body, and have been
seen feeding on the mud and sands of the estuary, and betaking
themselves to the woods at night to roost. These are evidently
migratory flocks, which have crossed Heligoland and landed on
our east coast without being actually observed in transit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, from Feb. 8th at Pentland Skerries to
April 23rd at same place. Only four records in that time.</p>

<p>In autumn, great coutinuous migration at Auskerry, July
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
30th, of old and young; light W. One flock on August 7th at
Pentland Skerries all day; one flock stayed from March 15th to
24th at Sumburgh Head, and many large flocks also seen to the
north of that place at the same time. In October two small
Starlings, "one with a crest like a Crested Lark, raised and
lowered it at will" [Rose-coloured Pastor?&mdash;J. A. H. B.] seen
on 6th, light N. wind. Rushes took place on Nov. 1st, especially
at Sumburgh Head and Isle of May (see also under <a href="#Turdidae">Thrush</a>).
Latest, Dec. 31st, at Isle of May; but the Starling is resident
all the year round at many of our stations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries,
Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest, Feb. 8th, a single bird at
Bell Rock, and several on 9th at Pentland Skerries (see under
<a href="#Turdidae">Thrush</a> at this date). Latest, April 6th, at Sumburgh Head,
when they were found increasing, but not observed on arrival. A
rush took place at Isle of May on Feb. 11th, 1 a.m. till daylight,
light E. and fog, flying south (at least all struck the north side
of lantern).<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Other movements took place, but none of any
magnitude; winds S. and W. in Feb., except the 11th, <i>ut sup.</i>;
N.W., S.W. to E. on 20th, in March.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Do the birds strike in light winds and fog upon the side facing the wind,
or on the sheltered side? In heavy gales they strike <i>hard with the wind</i>,
but touch and strike also on the Shetland side,</p>

</div>

<p>In autumn, a few records at N. Unst, Isle of May, and Inch-keith.
Earliest, Sept. 21st, at Isle of May, a small flock, fresh
E., clear. Latest, Nov. 26th, a single bird at N. Unst rested all
night. Rushes, 11th to 20th, W., shifting to N. on 11th; W.
gale on 19th and 20th. Also rush on 31st and Nov. 1st, along
with other species, principally, at Bell Rock and Isle of May.
Again a few in January, 1884, up to 17th, light W. winds and haze;
and at Chanonry on 24th a flock, with strong squalls and sleet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring Snow Buntings began to appear on
Feb. 9th,&mdash;but this may not belong to spring records,&mdash;when a
large flock flew about all day on Pentland Skerries. They
occurred also at Auskerry, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries,
and Isle of May. Earliest, as above. Latest, April 12th, at
Sumburgh Head, when two were killed. No great rushes
evident, but largest numbers passed in March, mostly with
northerly or westerly winds. If any rush occurred it was between
March 9th and 25th, indicated principally at Pentland Skerries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span>
and Isle of May. On 23rd, at Isle of May, a flock flying north.
Common Bunting seen at Isle of May on Feb. 12th, and again
on April 6th. Yellow Buntings at same place on March 5th and
April 7th, in both cases females.</p>

<p>In autumn, as usual, we have numerous records, especially
of Snow Buntings, at most stations, <i>viz.</i>, N. Unst, Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, Tarbat Ness, Dunnet Head, Bell Rock,
and Isle of May. Earliest at Isle of May on Sept. 21st. A
rush on 22nd and 27th; fresh E. to heavy S.W. gale on 26th
and 27th. Latest records to Jan. 18th, 1884. Bushes in
September <i>ut sup.</i>, a few in October, many all through November,
but principally on 13th-15th, 16th, and in lesser degree on 1st
and 2nd. Snow Buntings often appear with gales and snow or
sleet, but during this month S. and W. winds rather prevailed.
They arrived before the great W. gales, which began about the
16th. Of other species we have as follows: Yellow Bunting,
"Grey Bunting," "Green Bunting" (? Green Linnet), and
Cirl Bunting (one bird sent in spirits was not a Cirl Bunting,
but a young male Yellow Bunting). All these are recorded from
Isle of May, but no other station, and are distributed almost
entirely in October and December; prevailing winds westerly,
with stormy weather and gales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;One spring record from Cromarty station: Arrived
on April 29th; E., fresh breeze, haze.</p>

<p>One autumn record only, and the only record I have received
from any station during autumn migration, <i>viz.</i>, one young bird
at Isle of May on August 23rd, light W., clear. Possibly amongst
the many records of "Hawks" at other stations some occurrences
of the young brown-coloured Cuckoo may have been included, as
they are very like small Hawks in their flight.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Cuckoo heard at Dunipace, Stirlingshire, on
April 9th, 1883, a very early record. Not heard again till May.
Cuckoo recorded from Busby, at Lee Farm, near Sheddens, on April
14th. Cuckoo heard on Tinwald Downs, Dumfries, on April 23rd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring a Tawny Owl at Isle of May on April
28th, S.E. fresh, haze; and at Auskerry an Owl (which is
probably the Short-eared Owl) came on the 14th, with stiff S.E.
and showers, and remained a week. "This Owl visits Auskerry
annually in May."</p>

<p>In autumn, in September, one Owl on 28th at Pentland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span>
Skerries, strong N.N.E. and showers. In October four single
records of Large Owl at Pentland Skerries on 31st and 13th, and
of Short-eared Owls at Isle of May on 3rd and 13th. None in
December, and one Owl at Pentland Skerries all day on island
on 1st; light N.W. showers.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Short-eared Owls were reported unusually
abundant on Flanders Moss, Stirlingshire, in the autumn; and
I saw two as late as the 31st January, 1884, on Latham Moss, in
the same county, so that some appear to remain all winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records in March and April only, March
2nd to April 30th. At Pentland Skerries and Isle of May all
single or light entries; wind easterly, except on March 2nd,
when it was S.W. and clear, and one Kestrel was seen. The
Merlin is twice noted. "Light Brown Hawks twice at Isle of
May and Pentland Skerries."</p>

<p>In the autumn, at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell
Rock, and Isle of May. All July records, three in number, at
Pentland Skerries, of "Sparrowhawk," "Large Brown Hawk,"
and "Large Hawk." In August five records, three at Isle of
May of Sparrowhawk and "Hawks"; one at Pentland Skerries of
"Falcon Hawk"; and one at Sumburgh Head of one Large
Brown Hawk. The "Falcon Hawk" is described as "hovering,"
so is more likely a <i>Kestrel Hawk</i>. In September ten records;
two at Pentland Skerries, two "Hawks" and one "Game Hawk,"
and at Isle of May one Sparrowhawk caught at gratings, and a
"Hawk." Hawks are usually found attending the rush of
small migrants. In October only one record, a Game Hawk at
Pentland Skerries; four in November, all at Pentland Skerries.
None in December, and five in January, 1884. One bird Mr.
Agnew "feels almost sure was a Goshawk, and not a Sparrowhawk."
The rush, if any, would appear to be in September, but
its faintness precludes us from any feeling of certainty. A late
schedule from Sumburgh Head contains record of an Eagle
["Silver-crested Eagle"; probably the Sea Eagle] wounded at
Fitful Head by Mr. Birnie. At 11.15 a.m. on January 29th,
1884, this bird landed on the high rocks, half a mile north of
the Read. Mr. Birnie says it cannot live long, as it was severely
wounded. Mr. Birnie is employed by the landed proprietors to
kill all the birds of prey in Shetland. He has killed a large
number of Black-backed Gulls, Hooded Crows, Ravens, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In entering records of Gannets or Solan Geese
I believe the best way is to arrange the data in tabular form.
Spring records are only returned from Pentland Skerries; but,
considering the central position on the tract through the Pentland

desire to arrive at conclusions regarding the movements of this

<p>The annual regularity with which the Solan Geese pass and
repass through the Pentland Firth and various other points of
observation cannot, we think, fail to develop, by the statistics
accumulated, some curious facts in migration. We are thus
careful to record these with some minuteness of detail. A late
schedule from Sumburgh Head has&mdash;"Two on 16th, Sumburgh
Head. Eighteen Gannets flying S.W., 12 noon; strong

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Very few records either in spring or autumn.
Spring: none. Autumn: Swans on Aug. 15th, at Tarbat Ness,
two from the N., flying S.E. at 1 p.m.; N. strong, and clear.
The only other records are in October, a large flock flying E.
past Pentland Skerries at 12.20 p.m., with light W. and showers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span>
"very rarely seen here." On 19th, Ducks (sp.?), three flying

females, all day; strong due S.; left at night. At Chanonry,
local movements of Grey Geese and Grey Ducks to and fro in
stormy weather, or from feeding to nesting ground. At Sumburgh
Head, twenty-eight wild Geese flying S.; strong S.W., and snow
on 25th; and on 28th sixteen wild Geese, also flying S.; gale
from N.W. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;At Kirkwall, twenty-five wild Swans
frequented the Loch of Banks, and are described as being "very
tame" ('Scotsman,' 27, iii., 83). A very large flock of Pink-footed
or Bean Geese, probably the former, seen flying very high
towards S.E. and crying, at Kippen on March 23rd. Fully 150
Wild Geese remained on Flanders Moss all spring after this date,
and were seen last on April 23rd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, few records at Pentland Skerries
and Bell Rock. On Feb. 19th, at former station, three Rock
Doves flying E., 7 a.m.; S.W., fresh, clear. On March 4th,
two Rock Doves at same station, seen at 3 p.m.; light variable,
and haze. On April 20th, one Wood Pigeon at same station
flying S.E.; fair S.S.E., fog. On May 12th, one Woodpecker
flying S.W. past Bell Rock, 1.12 p.m.; strong S.W.; and on 28th,
a few Rock Doves at Pentland Skerries; strong S., and fog.</p>

<p>In autumn only two records; one at Pentland Skerries,
twelve Rock Pigeons, on July 23rd, on island; light N., haze
and rain; and on Sept. 16th, one Wood Pigeon at 2 p.m., at
Bell Rock, flying S.W.; light S.W. breeze.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;A male <i>Columba &#339;nas</i> (Stock Dove) was shot
at Garden, in this county (Stirlingshire), on March 15th, 1883.
This species has been rapidly extending its range of late years
in Scotland. See my paper on the Stock Dove (Ryl. Phyl. Soc.
Edinb., 1883, p. 241, Feb. 21st). In 1884 at least four pairs are
breeding in the Vale of Menteith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records meagre. One heard at Isle of May
April 28th, marked "rare here." One heard at Pentland Skerries
on May 6th, 5.50 p.m.; mod. S.S.E., clear. One heard
first time at Cromarty station on May 20th; strong E., clear.</p>

<p>No autumn records this season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records meagre. April 18th, at Pentland
Skerries, three Golden Plovers at 5 p.m.; S.S.W. May 15th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span>
at Auskerry, large flocks of Plovers all day; light E., and showers.
May 17th, at Isle of May, one Oystercatcher; W., very fine.</p>

<p>Autumn records almost equally meagre. July 13th, at Pentland
Skerries, one Golden Plover; fair N., light showers. Aug.
8th, at Pentland Skerries, one Golden Plover; strong S.E. Aug.
14th, at Pentland Skerries, one Golden Plover; light S.E.,
showers. Sept. 6th, at Isle of May, six Golden Plovers; strong
W., clear. Oct. 26th, at Pentland Skerries, one "Silver Plover"
(? Knot) killed at lantern; strong W., showers.</p>

<p>Of Lapwings, records are almost equally scanty. In spring,
on Feb. 17th, a flock all day at Pentland Skerries; light S.
breeze (see <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Thrush</span></a>). In March, along with the rush of other
migrants on 2nd at Isle of May; strong W., clear; and a number
on 3rd. Lots of sixteen and twenty on the 10th and 20th of
same month; light E. and S.E., fog, rain, and haze.</p>

<p>In autumn five Ringed Plovers stayed for some days on Isle
of May on and after Aug. 28th; came with light W., and clear&mdash;the
only record given of any <span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;</span> in autumn. At
Chanonry, numerous records of Lapwings lighting on the point,
or passing in stormy weather or in strong breezes, in Sept. to
January, 1884. A late schedule from Sumburgh Head has a
record of Lapwings on Jan. 24th, with the remark, "I believe
they have never been seen here at this season of the year before."</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Lapwings seen in pairs on March 4th at
breeding stations in Stirlingshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring. Curlews first heard at Pentland Skerries
on March 2nd, when heard at 2.15 p.m.; mod. N.W., fog.
Last on June 29th (but probably belongs to autumn) at same
place, when a flock flying S.; light S., clear. A rush between
April 7th and 15th, a few flying south between these dates at Isle
of May,&mdash;scarcely an appreciable rush,&mdash;and one record in May.</p>

<p>In autumn, not a great many records of Curlews. Earliest
July 4th, at Pentland Skerries, and on 15th and 29th at same
station; also in August, and at same station a few records,
most probably local movements. An apparent slight indication
of a rush of Curlews in September at three stations,&mdash;Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May,&mdash;young and old; and
up to 23rd, at Isle of May, numbers daily. Fewer in October,
and occasional records up to January, 1884.</p>

<p>Of Snipe, a few scattered records in spring, in March and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">-27-</span>
April. March 2nd to 9th, at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May;
and April 12th and 26th, at same stations, winds mostly westerly;
but on March 8th E.N.E., gale and snow.</p>

<p>In autumn, not abundant either, and scarcely require details.
Occurred in July, August, October (a large flock at Sumburgh
Head on 18th; gale and sleet showers), and December. In
July, at Pentland Skerries only; in August, ditto; in September,
not at all. In October, at Sumburgh Head and Pentland Skerries
(and a Jack Snipe at Isle of May). December, at Sumburgh
Head (a large number all day on 3rd); strong breezes, snow-showers;
and a Jack Snipe at Pentland Skerries on 24th.</p>

<p>Woodcock.&mdash;In spring, one record on April 7th, at Bell Rock,
flying about the rock.</p>

<p>In autumn, Oct. 13th and 14th, two single birds at Isle of
May and Pentland Skerries; and on Nov. 1st and 13th, at Isle of
May, N. Unst, and Shetland. The one on 1st accompanied the
rush of other migrants. On Oct. 13th six were shot on Isle of
May; wind due S., an unusual wind for migrants to arrive at
Isle of May. At Chanonry, many local records of "Whaups"
(Curlews)&mdash;probably the same flock of forty or fifty&mdash;appearing
in stormy weather.</p>

<p><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;On the night of March 26th, at Dunipace,
whilst standing at the front door (night bright and starry,
and frost), a large flock of birds crossed overhead, flying
south. The cries were difficult to make out, but belonged either
to Whimbrels or other species of wader. The subject of the
sounds of bird-cries at night would form good matter for
explanation by those who have constant opportunities of hearing
them. Wind N.E. up to March 27th, when a S.W. gale, shifting
to S., with heavy rain. About fifty Curlews were seen at
Caldarvon, west of this county, on March 11th, and three pairs
on 17th (auct. Jas. Lumsden).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;</span> (Waders).&mdash;Earliest spring migrants were Sandpipers
and Redshanks at Pentland Skerries on Feb. 9th (time of
migration of Thrushes, <i>q.v.</i>); and on 17th, ditto. On April 27th
a Purple Sandpiper at Isle of May (No. 57 in spirits).</p>

<p>Autumn. Earliest July 20th, at Pentland Skerries, Redshanks;
and a few records of these and Sandpipers to 31st. In
August a few records of the same, and one Turnstone (identified)
(No. 60 in spirits). In September great flocks of Sandpipers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">-28-</span>
flew in rays of light at 9 p.m.; light E.N.E., and fog. In end
of October and beginning of November Sandpipers and Red-shanks
participated in the rush of migrants at that time at
Pentland Skerries especially; light S.W. Large numbers on
5th; strong N.W., and showers; and numbers up to 21st, all
day; strong N.W. In December, rushes on 12th; N.W. gale,
snow; and up to 21st, very likely local movements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Records of either migration very scanty. First
seen in spring was at Pentland Skerries on May 13th, at 3.30 p.m.;
light S.W., haze; and again at same place two seen flying north
on June 20th. On June 3rd, at Sumburgh Head, two; fresh W.,
cloudy. Lesser Terns arrived at Cromarty on May 23rd.</p>

<p>In autumn, first record Aug. 7th, at Pentland Skerries, when
those breeding there all left, except one or two, with fresh N.W.,
clear. At Bell Rock, on Sept. 19th, a flock kept flying round the
rays of light all night (<i>i.e.</i>, 19th-20th); light E.N.E.; and on
Sept. 27th one immature bird appeared after a heavy gale from
W. the previous night. The above, I think, is the first occurrence
I have of Terns flying round and round within the rays of
light of a lantern. Lesser Terns disappeared from Cromarty on
Aug. 26th; S.W., strong, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, large numbers arrive about March 1st
for breeding purposes at Pentland Skerries, and leave about the
middle of August. On March 21st, at Isle of May, Kittiwakes
arrived in large numbers at 9 a.m.&mdash;their first appearance; wind
fresh E.S.E., cloudy and cold; and by April 3rd had steadily
increased in numbers. At Auskerry, May 18th is given as first
appearance of "Sea Maws"; strong N.W., and haze; and a
Black-headed Gull was seen, with light N.E. and clear, at Pentland
Skerries. At same station, record of two Black-backed Gulls
on June 27th; fresh S.E., and haze completes spring records.</p>

<p>In autumn, at Pentland Skerries during July the daily movements
of Gulls may be worth reproducing in detail. All the July
records I have are from this station, and also all the August ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

3 p.m., and one flying S. at 5 p.m.); mod. S.W., clear.</p>

<p>Aug. 20th, Pentland Skerries, one "Chaser" flying S.E., 12.50
p.m.; strong S.E., haze.</p>
</div>

<p>On 15th, at Dunnet Head, Gulls leave breeding-places in
cliffs. Our correspondent includes both "Chasers" and a
"Dirty Allan," both of which names I held as applicable to
the commonest species of Skua; but here they seem to be
divided, as applying to two different species, probably Richardson's
(common) Skua and the Pomatorhine Skua.</p>

<p>"Dirty Allans" are again recorded from Isle of May, along
with a rush of small birds on Sept. 23rd; and in this case I
doubt not Mr. Agnew applies the name to Richardson's Skua.
This is the only September record. In October only two records
at N. Unst; two pairs of Iceland Gulls stayed two days, coming
on the 4th with fresh N. and clear; and two pairs more on 21st
hovering round at 11 a.m.; fresh N., clear.</p>

<p>In November and December the greatest movements are
noticed, which I give in detail:&mdash;Nov. 2nd, Pentland Skerries,
several Kittiwakes flying S.E., noon; fresh S.W. Nov. 10th,
Isle of May, thousands of Gulls (?); W. gale, clear; first seen at
4 a.m., wind shifting to north. Nov. 11th, Isle of May, all the
above gone; light N.W., clear. These may have been Glaucous,
from description, but this is not clear; and from subsequent records
I have preferred to consider them Herring, though Mr. Agnew includes
the latter later by name, I believe Mr. Agnew knows the
Glaucous and Iceland Gulls well. <i>Land Note.</i>&mdash;There has not
been a large migration of Glaucous and Iceland Gulls at Kincardine
on Forth for many years.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nov. 17th, Isle of May, hundreds of Herring Gulls came from
S.E. all day; light N.W. "Grey Gulls" mixed with Blackbacks,
the latter one in twenty.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span>
<p>Nov. 18th, Isle of May, every Gull gone; light N.W.</p>

<p>Nov. 24th, Isle of May, hundreds of Herring Gulls came from
S.E. all day; fresh W.; also accompanied by smaller numbers
of Black-backs.</p>

<p>Dec. 13th, Pentland Skerries, two Black-backed Gulls on island,
12.30 p.m.; N.W. gale.</p>

<p>Dec. 3rd, Isle of May, thousands of "Gulls," 3 p.m.; W., clear.</p>

<p>1884, Jan. 22nd, Isle of May, large light-coloured Gulls with
black tips to wings; gale W. last night.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;There is evidently considerable confusion existing
regarding the various species of Sea Gulls; and this is not to be
wondered at when the innumerable phases of plumage in even the
same species, according to maturity or immaturity, is considered.
What is sadly wanted in such a quest as ours is a series of cheap
yet fairly well executed plates of birds in all phases of plumage,
with measurements to scale; but the almost impossibility of
issuing such at a sufficiently low price for general distribution
must, we fear, for ever debar our correspondents from obtaining
such a means of assistance. M. De La Rue issues marvels of
cheapness in Christmas Cards; could he not undertake something
in this line? His pictures of birds are admirable, but he
would have to keep up the standard, or even improve it, to be of
scientific value to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Records scarce in spring and autumn. At
Auskerry, arrived for first time on July 30th, but as early as 6th
eggs were laid at Pentland Skerries. Being a bird of nocturnal
habits, the arrival cannot, we fancy, be easily fixed at all times.
At Auskerry, on 8th, two pairs had two eggs each (some notes on
the schedule margin here have been torn off and lost, J. A. H. B.)
On Sept. 25th one struck at Dunnet Head; S.S.W., fog; and on
26th six struck and rested from 9 to 11 p.m.; S.E. fresh, and
haze. It is seldom so many are recorded at the same time. Are
these Pentland Skerries birds? At Noss Head, on Aug. 28th
and on 30th, one Stormy Petrel each time struck, but not
killed, with W.N.W. fresh on former date, and light S.E. and
haze on latter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring. First visit at Isle of May on March 21st,
when "not very many" appeared, with fresh E.S.E. Guillemots
and Razorbills. Next visit at Isle of May, large numbers on
April 1st with light W., and in dear weather. Increased on 3rd,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">-31-</span>
and on April 27th arrived again finally, after a few days' absence,
with fresh S.E. and haze. These and other rock birds breeding
here all left on Aug, 10th, except a few Kittiwakes and Eider
Ducks, after a heavy W. gale on 9th (see August, below). Puffins
were first observed at Isle of May; however, not before May 4th,
when a few showed.</p>

<p>Following this comes what may be considered local flights, in
search of food, to and from the fishing grounds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>May 16th, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks flying E.; light
breeze N.E.</p>

<p>May 21st, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks flying E.; light
W., haze.</p>

<p>June 4th, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks flying S.E.; light
N.E., haze.</p>

<p>June 6th, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks flying S.E.; light
E., haze.</p>

<p>June 17th to 20th, Pentland Skerries, continuous rush flying S.E.;
strong N. to light E. and W.</p>

<p>June 21st, Pentland Skerries, several flocks all day flying S.E.;
lights.</p>

<p>June 25th, Pentland Skerries, large flocks, 7.15 p.m., flying S.E.;
fresh S.E., fog and rain.</p>

<p>June 29th, Pentland Skerries, a few around; light S., clear.</p>
</div>

<p>We now come to the autumn movement, if we take the same
dates as for many land birds; but this is apt to be mixed up with
the later summer movements of old and young birds, and therefore
we will keep July by itself. All the records here relate, as
before, to Pentland Skerries. An equally exact record from each
salient or conspicuous station round our coasts could not fail to
give us exact knowledge as regards the movements of sea-fowl,
or rather of rock birds. Food-supply is an important factor in
the local as well as the other migrations. A knowledge of
fishing-grounds would thereby be achieved; and a knowledge of
the two subjects, migration of birds and geography of the distribution
of fishes, would undoubtedly help each other. With these
remarks we continue our records for July, believing that this
simple tabular form is most useful in the present case, though
cumbrous if carried on in every instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span></p>

<p><i>July debatable ground,</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>July 5th, Pentland Skerries, a flock 8.20 p.m.; mod. E., fog and
showers.</p>

<p>July 6th, Pentland Skerries, several flocks all day; light S., haze.</p>

<p>July 7th, Pentland Skerries, several flocks all day flying E.; mod.

<p>July 18th, Pentland Skerries, a few flocks all day; mod. N.W., clear.</p>

<p>July 25th, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks all day; mod.
N.E., clear.</p>

<p>July 26th, Pentland Skerries, continuous flocks all day flying E.
and S.E.; fresh N., haze.</p>
</div>

<p>The last two entries appear to me to indicate decision in
commencing the autumn migration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aug. 15th, Dunnet Head, rock birds leave about this time.</p>

<p>Aug. 10th, Isle of May, all rock birds left, except a few Kittiwakes;

<p>Nov. 27th, Isle of May, abundant in sea along with Gulls;
"Garvies," <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Culpea sprattus</i>, abundant (J. A. H. B.).</p>

<p>Dec. 20th, Isle of May, large numbers; fresh W., haze.</p>

<p>Dec. 27th, Isle of May, large numbers; S.W., haze.</p>
</div>

<p>This completes our data of Guillemots and Razorbills, to
which the whole of the above records refer for 1883; and I think
it shows pretty plainly the life-history of these birds, at least in
some important particulars. A wider appreciation can be arrived
at if similar tabular returns come in from other salient points of
observation, such as Isle of May, Bell Rock, and one or two
stations on the east coast; and Cape Wrath, Butt of Lewis,
Monach Isles, and Barra Head on the west coast; and also for
summer migrations, especially such stations as Island Ghlais,
Skerryvore, and Dhuheartach, and others on the inner line of
stations of the west coast.</p>

<p>These data are minutely detailed here this year, because I
have felt more at liberty to do so, owing to the light returns of most
of our land birds, thus having more space than usual at command.</p>

<p>Further remarks, should such occur to us, will appear in the
"General Observations," which I withhold till the close of the
West Coast Report.</p>

</div>


<p>Printed schedules and letters of instruction were forwarded
to thirty-seven lighthouses and light-vessels on the East
Coast of England, and two stations in the Channel Islands,
and returns have been received from twenty-five, against thirty
in 1882.</p>

<p>Independent reports have also been received from Heligoland,
and certain land stations along the East Coast, namely, Seaton-Carew,
Redcar, Flamborough, Spurn, North-East Lincolnshire,
Wells (on the Norfolk coast), Northrepps, Great Yarmouth, and
the coast of Essex. Making altogether a total of thirty-five
reporting stations, against thirty-seven in 1882.</p>

<p>Our best thanks are due to H. G&auml;tke, T. H. Nelson, C. Donald-Thompson,
Matthew Bailey, William Eagle Clarke, J. H. Gurney,
jun., M. Vaughan, of Haileybury College, Arthur Patterson, and
Colonel Russell, for their hearty co-operation and assistance, as
well as to the numerous kind and painstaking observers at the
lighthouses and light-vessels, whose names are given in the list
of stations. Special thanks are due to Mr. Gurney for having
inaugurated along the Norfolk coast a parallel system of enquiry,
which for a first trial has worked well. In all doubtful cases of
identity, where birds are killed against the lanterns, a wing is
cut off, and with a label of the date attached these have been
forwarded in batches to Mr. Gurney for identification, and with
satisfactory results. We cannot too strongly urge upon our
observers the advantages of this system, and advise them to
adopt it; nothing is easier than to cut off a wing from each
victim on any given night, wrap them in paper, or tie them
together, with the dates attached, or numbered on the cover, and
send them in one parcel by post either to myself or to Mr. Gurney,
for identification. It is intended that instructions for doing this
will be given in the next issue of schedules in the spring of this
year.</p>

<p><i>Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i>, Wheatear.&mdash;Spring, Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 2nd
to 24th; many on 14th. Flamborough, 5th, 1.20 a.m., one
struck. Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, May 10th, twenty going from S.E. to N.W.
Autumn, Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, from July 20th, 2 p.m., N.E., several, to
Nov. 7th; Llyn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, one struck (wing sent to Mr. Gurney).
In considerable numbers in September and October, covering the
whole coast line; in the former month associated, as usual, with
Redstarts. At the Farn and Longstone lighthouses, Sept. 2nd
and 3rd, E., great numbers of both crossing, and on 24th with
both Redstarts and Snow Buntings. Heligoland, Aug. 6th to 7th,
a few, S.E. wind, and on to 20th numerous, all young; 21st to
24th, in astounding numbers; Sept. 10th, enormous rush, and
11th and 12th, less.</p>

<p><i>Pratincola rubetra</i>, Whinchat.&mdash;Heligoland, Aug. 21st, 22nd,
and 24th, great many young birds.</p>

<p><i>P. rubicola</i>, Stonechat.&mdash;Spring, Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Feb. 23rd, one.
Autumn, same station, Aug. 8th, many to S. Spurn, Oct. 23rd,
many. Stonechats have frequented the sheep-folds on the turnip-fields
in Lincolnshire throughout the whole of the late mild
winter. Heligoland, Oct. 20th, one young bird; Oct. 11th, S.S.W.,
<i>P. rubicola</i> (<i>indica</i>)? "with coloration just like a young autumn

April 13th, 4 a.m., S., one male against lantern. Autumn, same
station, Aug. 30th, one male, 1 a.m., against lantern. Numerous

associated frequently with Wheatears. Heligoland, Sept. 9th to
Oct. 1st; on Sept. 10th enormous numbers, 14th great many,
and 17th to 21st also great many.</p>

<p><i>Ruticilla titys</i>, Black Redstart.&mdash;Spurn, Oct. 23rd, one seen
(in 1882 at the Spurn, Oct. 29th). Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Oct. 28th, one,
young male or old female (wing to J. H. G.); I have no doubt
it occurs regularly as an autumn immigrant on our east coast,
and may be expected about four weeks later than the Redstart.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Heligoland, Oct. 27th, eight or ten.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Messrs. Clarke and Roebuck state, in their 'Handbook of Yorkshire
Vertebrata,' p. 19, that "Mr. M. Bailey, of Flamborough, has frequently
observed these birds in spring on their arrival on the headland, and has
known them killed by flying against the light in thick, foggy weather, with
the wind E.N.E. He has also seen them on their departure in September,
and has noticed several in October and November."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Cyanecula suecica</i>, Red-spotted Bluethroat.&mdash;One, coast of
Northumberland late in September; one, Redcar, 21st, on Tees
breakwater; one about same time at the Spurn, but not obtained;
ten, coast of Norfolk, in same month; and about twenty others
seen there by a competent authority, Mr. Power. All obtained
were birds of the year.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The gizzard of one of these Norfolk
birds which I examined was crammed with the broken remains
of small beetles having a bright metallic lustre, but the remains
were much broken and comminuted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Mr. G&auml;tke says "the other form, <i>S. leucocyanea</i>, Brehm, comes very
rarely so far north as Heligoland, and when it turns up it always does so four
to six weeks earlier than the suecica in the spring."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Erithacus rubecula</i>, Redbreast.&mdash;First at the Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,

14th, covering the entire coast-line; rushes on Sept. 21st and
30th, Oct. 6th and 7th. Heligoland, Sept. 24th to Nov. 23rd;
rushes on Sept. 24th, and Oct. 3rd to 7th.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on Oct. 15th, flights passed westward from 10 a.m. to
3 p.m., and at 6 p.m. fourteen were killed at lantern; the immigration

migration eighty-six days, against ninety-two in the preceding
year; line E. to W. Heligoland, Oct. 6th, not many yet; 7th,

<p><i>E. citrinella</i>, Yellowhammer.&mdash;May 13th, Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, great
many for several days. Heligoland, Nov. 2nd, many; 23rd,
some. <i>E. cirlus</i>, Cirl Bunting.&mdash;May, one, "completing with the
male obtained many years ago, the only pair."</p>

<p><i>E. hortulana</i>, Ortolan Bunting. Great Cotes, May 3rd, N.E.,
very sharp and cold, one seen, apparently an adult female [see
Cordeaux, Zool., vol. 1883, p. 253.] Heligoland, Aug. 21st,
22nd, and 24th, "astounding numbers"; Sept. 9th and 12th,
great many; 16th and 17th, first old birds. <i>E. rustica</i>, Rustic
Bunting, Sept. 24th, one shot by Ludwig G&auml;tke. <i>E. pusilla</i>,
Little Bunting, Sept. 24th, one shot; 30th, one.</p>

<p><i>E. sch&#339;niclus</i>, Reed Bunting.&mdash;Great Cotes, Nov. 16th, considerable
flight. Heligoland, Sept. 20th, pretty large numbers;
Oct. 11th, great many; 13th, some; and 31st, many.</p>

<p><i>Calcarius lapponicus</i>, Lapland Bunting.&mdash;Heligoland, Sept.
30th, some.</p>

<p><i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>, Snow Bunting.&mdash;Spring, Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
March 7th, two. Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 14th, "Snow-birds" to W. Languard
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, July 8th, a pair on beach, 6.30 p.m., seen by Mr.
Owen Boyle; certainly the earliest record for England of this
species. Autumn, first at Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept. 18th and 19th, one
flock each day to S.W., and to Jan. 9th, 1884. Redcar, several
flights to W.; a few recorded at stations between the Farn
Islands and Yarmouth in September, October, and November;
and from Dec. 1st to 29th in great numbers. At Great Cotes,
on Dec. 4th, thousands upon thousands, the stubbles near the
Humber fairly covered with their enormous flocks; young with a
sprinkling of old birds, one to forty. Heligoland, Nov. 6th,
early, very numerous passage; 12th and 14th, great many.</p>

<p><i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, Common Starling.&mdash;With few exceptions are
recorded at all our east coast stations, and often in immense
numbers, the occurrences being far too numerous to chronicle.
The bulk crossed in September, October, and November; less in
December; the line of flight and rushes corresponding with
those of the Lark, with which species they are very frequently
associated. Heligoland, from Oct. 1st to Nov. 12th; on Oct.
6th in "astounding flights, thousands upon thousands"; 12th,
"considerable numbers of astounding flights, both overhead and
in distance"; 13th, "still passing, astounding numbers all
day"; 26th, the same, very high; 27th, "night, from 11 p.m.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">-45-</span>
myriads"; 28th, "immense," and still great many to Nov. 12th.
These extracts from Mr. G&auml;tke's notes show the enormous
migration of this species across Heligoland in the autumn, and
the corresponding rush on to our east coast.</p>

<p><i>Pastor roseus</i>, Rose-coloured Pastor.&mdash;Heligoland, July 16th,
old male shot.</p>

<p><i>Pyrrhocorax graculus</i>, Chough.&mdash;Heligoland, April 15th, seen
for a whole week, but not obtained.</p>

<p><i>Corvus monedula</i>, Jackdaw.&mdash;Considerable numbers south of
Humber throughout the autumn. Heligoland, Oct. 26th, many;
27th and 29th, great flight.</p>

<p><i>Corvus corone</i>, Carrion Crow.&mdash;Spring, Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 8th,
seven to W. Autumn, Yarmouth, Oct. 14th, continuous flocks
of Carrion and Grey Crows coming in, and again on 27th. At
the Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, from Oct. 25th to Nov. 13th, great many;
also at other stations in October and November.</p>

<p><i>Corvus cornix</i>, Hooded Crow.&mdash;Migrates in company with
his near cousin, the Carrion Crow, as well as in separate flocks.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Spring, Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, May 25th, one Grey Crow on island, where it
ate three young Larks; on July 27th Mr. Owen Boyle saw five
on the beach off Languard. Autumn, first at Great Cotes, Oct.
4th, to Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Dec. 8th, fifty. Enormous numbers crossed
in October and November between the Farn Islands and Shipwash
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, off the coast of Essex, the main body arriving on the
flat coast of Lincolnshire and in Norfolk; great rushes occurred
on Oct. 9th, night of 12th, 20th, 27th, and 28th, and on to Nov.
2nd, and also Nov. 7th to 15th; under date Nov. 8th, Hasbro'
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> reports "continuous flocks of Black Crows and Grey Crows,
and Crows with white backs and bellies"; it would be difficult to
say what is intended by the latter. Heligoland, Oct. 1st, flights,
thirty to forty, to Nov. 12th.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Probably something like one-half of the entries in the schedules record

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Under date Oct. 6th, N.E., clear, fresh, Mr. G&auml;tke remarks:&mdash;"Across
the sea both sides of island (N. and S.), particularly on north side, countless
numbers of <i>cornix</i>, <i>sturnus</i>, and all kinds of small birds, all from E. to W.
This occurrence happens not rarely; during this ponderous migration there
were on the island nearly no birds."</p>

<p><i>Corvus frugilegus</i>, Rook.&mdash;Spring, Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, during March
and April, many flocks of Rooks and Crows are recorded as going
both to the west and east, as if a cross migration was going on to
and from the Continent. At the Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, March 20th, 24th,
and 26th, continuous Rooks and Crows to <i>west</i>. Llyn Wells,
April 30th, various flocks of Crows to <i>south-west</i>, and at the same
station, on Aug. 3rd and 4th, large flocks to <i>north north-east</i>.
Autumn, with scarcely an exception, at all stations between the
Spurn and South Foreland, from the last week in September to
the end of the third week in November; the rushes correspond
with those of the preceding.</p>

<p><i>Alauda arvensis</i>, Sky Lark.&mdash;As in previous years. Larks hare
crossed in immense numbers to the east coast; it would be quite
unnecessary to give each occurrence in detail, almost involving
the necessity of writing a separate report. They are recorded
at all stations from the Farn Islands to Gull <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, off the South
Foreland, from Sept. 1st to Jan. 3rd, 1884, and often continuously
night and day; rushes took place on Sept. 3rd, 4th,
and 21st, Oct. 6th and 8th, 10th to 14th, 27th to Nov. 2nd-14th;
and Dec. 27th and 30th; and again Jan. 3rd, 1884. Flocks
which come in at daybreak will continue to arrive till 12 or
1 p.m., when migration for the time ceases. Numbers are killed
during the night migration against the lanterns of the lighthouses
and light-vessels.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Heligoland, Oct. 5th to Nov. 8th;

the glare of the lamps, was seen to pounce on a Starling and carry it off.
Mr. F. Spurr writes, "this latter, a fine Horned Owl, has taken to visit the
lighthouse regularly; he takes his post just beneath the strong rays of light,
and from thence pounces on the small birds when they are frightened by
the glare." He goes on to say that he had seen it perched on the rail of the
balcony, when its eyes shone like living coals; just such a light as is visible
in the eyes of the night-flying moths when they settle on the pane.</p>

<p><i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>, Oystercatcher.&mdash;Llyn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Jan. 7th, 1884, one killed (J. H. G.).</p>

<p><i>Phalaropus hyperboreus</i>, Red-necked Phalarope.&mdash;Yarmouth,
Oct. 24th, one shot.</p>

<p><i>Scolopax rusticula</i>, Woodcock.&mdash;Flamborough <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 6th,
struck and killed. Two or three occurred at Teesmouth (Redcar),
last week in August, and a few in September. At Seaton Snook
and Flamborough on Sept. 21st. The "first flight" was on the
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk coasts, on the night of Oct.
21st, wind N.E. The "great flight," or rush, on the nights of
Oct. 28th and 29th, covering the whole of the E. coast, from the
Farn Islands to Yarmouth, the bulk coming probably into the
Humber district. A friend wrote me he had shot eighteen on
the morning of 29th, and might easily have doubled this number
if he had started early enough. From the 2nd to the 10th
of November stragglers continued to arrive between the Farn
Islands and Yarmouth. Heligoland, Sept. 22nd, first; Oct.
22nd, one hundred caught or shot; 28th, astounding passage of
Larks, Starlings, Peewits, Snipes and Woodcocks; Oct. 30th,
twenty to thirty shot; 31st, ten to twenty shot; 31st to Nov. 1st,
thirteen caught, a few stragglers to December 4th.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Mr. Clubley, of Kilnsea, near the Spurn, who during his life has
probably shot more Cock than anyone living on the east coast, says that a
S.E. wind always brings <i>large grey</i> or <i>light-coloured</i> Woodcocks, a N. wind
<i>small</i> and <i>red-coloured</i> birds&mdash;that is, Scandinavian birds. This rule seems
to hold good on other parts of our east coast. See also remarks by Mr. J.
Harvie-Brown.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The first great rush of <i>Tring&aelig;</i> across Heligoland was Aug. 6th and 7th;
14th also, all sorts; and on 21st and 22nd, same; again on night of Oct. 31st,
and morning of Nov. 1st.</p>

</div>

<p><i>T. subarquata</i>, Curlew Sandpiper.&mdash;Essex coast, August 1st,
Colonel Russell shot three from a flock of Oxbirds; they were in
partial moult; another was seen.</p>

<p><i>T. striata</i>, Purple Sandpiper.&mdash;Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, May 15th, 6 p.m.,
S.S.E., very large flock flying over island; and at the same
station, on Nov. 28th, very large flocks of Turnstone, Purple
Sandpiper and Redshank. Yarmouth, Oct. 5th, five seen.</p>

<p><i>T. canutus</i>, Knot.&mdash;Spurn, June 13th, flock arrived from S.
The first Knots in the autumn were seen at Yarmouth and
Redcar on Aug. 11th, and by the end of the month were
tolerably numerous along the east coast. Llyn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Sept.
22nd, N.N.E., large flocks to S. all day; at this station also,
from Oct. 20th to Jan. 6th, 1884, twenty-eight were killed
against the lantern.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The Knot at Blakeney is always called "Knet"; Godwit, a "Pick";
Dunlin, "Stint"; Whimbrel, "May-bird"; Turnstone, "Dotterel"; Ringed
Plover, "Oxbird." On the Essex coast the Whimbrel is a "May-bird" or
"Titterel," the latter from its cry; Godwits are "Pream;" Knot, "Marl";
Dunlin, "Oxbird"; Ringed Plover, "Stone-runner." At Spurn the Knot is
a "Plover-knot," but on the Lincolnshire coast simply a "Knot". Local
names, common to both sides of the Humber, are, Turnstone, "Dotterel";
Common Dotterel, "Land Dotterel," "Spring Dotterel"; Grey Plover,
"Pigeon," or "Buffel-headed Plover"; Dunlin, "Stint," or "Tommy Stint";
Ringed Plover, "Sand-runner"; Whimbrel, "Curlew-jack"; Godwit, "Curlew-whelp."
On the Durham coast the Knot is both a "Dunlin" and "Grey
Plover"; Dunlin, a "Stint"; Sanderling, "White Stint"; Whimbrel, "Curlew-jack";
Lapwing, a "Tyafit"; Godwit, "Goodwin." The local names of
birds vary so in different districts that they frequently become very puzzling
to the members of the Committee; it would greatly assist their labours and
facilitate enquiry if any fellow-worker would take the trouble to compile a
glossary of local names of our British birds. The investigation might be
rendered easy by sending printed forms to the best known ornithologists, in
their respective districts. The results could not fail to be both useful and
interesting.</p>

only a few being seen after that date. Yarmouth, Aug. 7th to
10th, Black, Common, and Arctic Terns along shore, and through
the month to 31st; in shore only when wind is westerly, in
flocks of ten to fifty, nine-tenths being young; it is the westerly
winds which bring in the herring "syle," on which the Terns
feed. The Sandwich Tern, <i>Sterna cantiaca</i>, arrived at the Farn
Islands between April 15th and 23rd, leaving again on Aug. 3rd.
At Languard Point, Mr. Owen Boyle saw on June 1st, 4.45 a.m.,

island at flood each day; Dec. 8th, two "Bass" Gulls; 12th,
one. "These Gulls are all cream-colour. I am not sure if they
are the Glaucous, so have given them the local name." At
Heligoland, young Glaucous Gulls, <i>L. glaucus</i>, were repeatedly
seen about island in December; and during the last week in
January, 1884, hundreds of Black-headed Gulls, <i>L. ridibundus</i>,
frequented the plateau of cliff, which Mr. G&auml;tke says is a "very
exceptional" circumstance there. <i>Xema sabinii</i>, Sabine's Gull,
an immature example was shot on. Oct. 28th, the second example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">-55-</span>
which has been obtained there; and on Nov. 10th a second

Petrel, <i>P. leucorrhoa</i>, from Happisburgh (Hasbro') <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> in
October. A Shearwater was seen at Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> July 20th, 6 a.m.,
going north; and at Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on Aug. 5th, 2 a.m., a Manx
Shearwater, <i>P. anglorum</i>, was killed against the lantern.
Breydon, Sept. 5th, one shot. In the latter part of the same
month two Sooty Shearwaters, P. griseus, were obtained in
Bridlington Bay, and taken to the shop of Mr. Jones, birdstuffer,

island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Podicipid&aelig;</span>, Grebes.&mdash;Bridlington, latter part of August,
Red-necked Grebe, <i>P. griseigena</i>, shot, in full summer plumage.
Spurn, Nov. 2nd, a few pairs of Little Grebes, <i>Tachybaptes
fluviatilis</i>, on ponds; and on Jan. 6th, 1884, three Great Crested
Grebes, <i>P. cristatus</i>, on the sea off point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;</span>, Auks.&mdash;At Flamborough, in February, 1884, great
numbers of Razorbills, <i>Alca torda</i>, all returned to their
nesting quarters on the cliffs, an unprecedented circumstance
there; and large numbers of the Common Guillemot were
reported by the fishermen as seen at sea off the headland.
At the Farn Islands, March 22nd, 1883, Guillemots had come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">-56-</span>
their nesting quarters, thousands arriving on April 1st. Puffins
on the 15th. On January 10th and 28th, 1884, on each day a
Black Guillemot, <i>Uria grylle</i>, was shot from the island. The
Little Auk, <i>Mergulus alle</i>, shot there on Dec. 29th; and on Feb.
4th and 5th, 1884, a great many were seen flying and swimming
about the islands, more than had ever been seen before.</p>

<p>The Committee are again indebted to Professor Chr. Fr.
L&uuml;tken, of the Universitetets Zoologiske Museum, Copenhagen, for
a list of the birds killed or taken against the lantern of the
lighthouse of Stevns, on the projecting part of Zealand, marking
the limit between the Baltic and Oresund, in the spring and
autumn of 1883. The list has been drawn up by Mr. Autander,
a physician living in the neighbourhood of the lighthouse. In
forwarding the list to Professor L&uuml;tken he states there has been
in this year only a few nights in which any number of birds have
been killed, in consequence of the sky being generally clear
during the time of the migration.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the Report a schedule has been
received from the Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> moored forty-eight miles
E.N.E. of Cromer, on the coast of Norfolk. From Feb. 11th to
May 8th, Skylarks, Black Crows, Rooks, Wild Ducks, Starlings,
and Goldcrests, are recorded as going in <i>westerly</i> directions; a like
anomalous direction was maintained during the same period at
the Outer Dowsing, Newarp, Cockle, and Llyn Wells light-vessels
by birds passing these stations. On May 8th a great many
Goldcrests came from the south at 11 a.m., and then went <i>west</i>.
Sept. 11th, great numbers of Goldcrests going from S.E. to W.;
and on Oct. 28th with Redbreasts and Wrens from S. to N.W.
Between Oct. 27th and Nov. 1st two hundred and eight birds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">-58-</span>
were killed or taken on the vessel, including seven Grey Crows,
Larks, Redbreasts, Wrens, Goldcrests, Starlings, Sparrows,
Chaffinches, and two Woodcocks; these birds were travelling
from S., S.E., and E. to N.W., N.N.W., and W.</p>

<p>Wings from Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> by Mr. Gurney. Oct. 10th, Tree
Sparrow and Chaffinch; 11th, Shore Lark; 13th, Great Tit;
27th, Chaffinch; 28th, Blackstart (young male or old female?),
Thrush; 30th, Meadow Pipit; Nov. 3rd, Jack Snipe and Water
Rail.</p>

<p>On April 9th, 1884, I received from Mr. Gurney the wing of
a Dabchick (Little Grebe), which struck the lantern of the
Hasbro' lighthouse at 11 p.m. on the night of March 30th. The
force was so great that the bird was split from the neck along the
entire length of body; and on April 8th a Hoopoe was killed
against the North Hasbro' <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, and the head, wings, and legs
sent to Mr. Gurney by Mr. B. V. Darnell, mate of that vessel.
A Hoopoe was also taken alive on April 10th, on board a
Grimsby smack when one hundred miles E.N.E. of the Spurn,
wind blowing strong from E., and had been for some days.</p>

<p>At Heligoland, on the night from Aug. 6th to 7th, S.E., a
considerable flight of the Silver Gamma Moth, <i>Plusia gamma</i>,
but nothing to be compared with the perfect snow-storms of this
moth which passed in the autumn of 1882, all going west. On
Oct. 11th, S.S.W., there was a considerable flight of <i>Hybernia
defoliaria</i>, the Mottled Umber Moth, mixed with <i>Hybernia aurantiaria</i>,
the scarce Umber; and also during the nights of the last
week in October repeated flights of these moths. With reference
to the great flight of <i>Plusia gamma</i> in 1882, a notice of which
appeared in our last Report, 1882, p. 47, Mr. Charles Williams,
of the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, sends this note:&mdash;"Seeing Mr.
G&auml;tke's remarks in your Report about the Gamma Moth, I beg
to say that they were here in June or July."</p>

<p>At the Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Nov. 18th, "a large Seal came quite close to
vessel, largest I've ever seen." As the Common Seal is well
known at the mouth of the Tees, this probably may have been
the Grey Seal, <i>Halich&#339;rus gryphus</i>.</p>

<p>From Flamborough comes the announcement that, on Feb.
18th, that rare fish, the Ribbon or Oar-fish, <i>Regalecus banksii</i>,
was found alive amongst the rocks on the south side near the
Head; it measured thirteen feet three inches in length, sixteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">-59-</span>
inches in depth, and five and a half inches in thickness; it was
supposed to have been brought in by the tremendous easterly
swell of the last few days. It was purchased by Mr. Whittaker,
of Scarborough, for thirty pounds.</p>


<p class="caption3nb smcap">General Remarks.</p>

<p>The observations taken on the East Coast of England in 1883
have been such as to generally confirm the conclusions arrived at
in previous Report, having special reference to directions of
flight and lines of migration.</p>

<p>The winter of 1883-84 has been exceptionally mild, and there
has been an almost entire absence of severe frosts and lasting
snow-storms; the prevailing winds in the autumn W. and S.W.&mdash;such
as we know are specially favourable for the passage of the
North Sea by great flights of birds, and their direct movement
inland without alighting to rest or recruit themselves in the east
coast districts. Our land stations report a great scarcity both of
land and sea-birds; this has not, however, been the case at sea
stations&mdash;that is, light-vessels situated off the coast at distances
varying from five to fifty miles; here the stream of migration, so
far from showing any abatement, has flown steadily on in a full
tide, and, judging from the well-filled schedules that have been
returned, there appears to have been a decided increase in the
migrants passing these distant stations&mdash;due, perhaps, in some
measure to increased interest and improved observations. Mr.
Wm. Stock, of the Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, remarks that he had
never before seen so many birds past that station. The rush
also over Heligoland during the autumn was enormous. Migration
is more marked there than on the English coast; there was
a great movement of various species passing forward on the 6th
and 7th of August, and again on the 14th, and more pronounced
still on the 21st and 22nd.</p>

<p>The first great rush of birds on the English coast was on
Sept. 21st, and two following days; and a similar great movement
or rush is indicated in Mr. G&auml;tke's notes from his island
outpost, as well as on our more distant light-ships. The prevailing
winds on the North Sea on Sept. 21st were moderate
north-easterly and easterly off the coasts of Denmark and
Holland, blowing strong easterly on to our northern coasts north
of the Humber, with southerly and south-westerly off the southeast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span>
coasts, causing cross-currents over the North sea. Whatever
then was the impulse, atmospheric or otherwise, which
induced such an immense rush of various birds at this time, it
was one which acted alike, and with precisely the same impulse,
on the Sea Eagle and tiny Goldcrest.</p>

<p>The second great rush was on the 12th and 13th of October,
a similar movement being recorded at Heligoland. Then again
from the 27th to the 31st, and somewhat less through the first
week in November, the passage across Heligoland, as well as the
rush on our east coast, was enormous. Speaking of the nights
from the 27th to 31st inclusive, Mr. G&auml;tke says, "This was the
first move by the million; for four nights there has been a
gigantic feathery tide running." During this time there were
variable winds over the North Sea, but generally easterly and
south-easterly on the Continent; but strong west winds and
squalls prevailing generally on the 5th and 6th of November.
With the outburst of some severe weather during the first week
in December a considerable local movement is indicated along
our coast from north to south, culminating in the enormous rush
of Snow Buntings into Lincolnshire about the end of the first
week in that month. A careful perusal of the Report will show
how generally the rushes across Heligoland correlate with those
observed on our east coast, although not always confined to the
same species in both localities.</p>

<p>A somewhat remarkable and very anomalous movement of
migrants is recorded in the schedules from some of the light-vessels
off the Lincolnshire and Norfolk coasts in the spring of
1883. In February, March, April, and May, birds passing the
Leman and Ower, Llyn Wells, Outer Dowsing, Newarp, and
Cockle light-vessels were as a rule coming from easterly and
passing in westerly directions. Had this movement been noticed
at one station only we might perhaps have been inclined to doubt
the accuracy of the return, but the fact of five light-vessels having
no communication with each other reporting the same circumstance
proves the correctness of the observations. A summary
of the spring quarter at these stations shows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, March 31st to May 18th, Sparrows,
Chaffinches, Wrens, Rooks, Larks, Tree Sparrows, Linnets,
Titlarks, Bullfinches, from E., S.E., E. by S., and N.E. to W,
N.W., W.N.W., and W.S.W.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">-61-</span></p>

<p>Llyn Wells <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, April 30th, various flocks of Crows to S.W.</p>

<p>Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, March 17th to April 15th, Crows on six days to W.</p>

<p>Leman and Ower <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Feb. 18th to May 8th, Skylarks, Starlings,
Titlarks, Goldcrests, E. and E.S.E. to N.W.</p>

<p>Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Feb. 22nd to March 31st, Black Crows, Ducks,
Jackdaws, Starlings, Larks, Lapwings, "Snow-birds" to W.
On March 20th, 24th, and 26th, Black Crows or Rooks continuous
from 5.50 a.m. to 11 a.m., E. to W.; and on 31st also
continuous from morning to night in the same direction.</p>

<p>All these entries show a great immigration to our coast from
the east in the spring months, and on precisely the same lines
and directions as are travelled by these birds in the autumn.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the autumn migration is the occurrence
of a flight of the Blue-throated Warbler, <i>Cyanecula suecica</i>;
twelve altogether were obtained, all being birds of the year, and
nine of these on the coast of Norfolk, besides about twenty
others seen by competent observers.</p>

<p>Very few Goldcrests, compared with the enormous flights of
the previous autumn, have crossed, and the same scarcity is
observable in the Heligoland return. Curiously enough, the
Hedgesparrow, <i>Accentor modularis</i>, which migrated in such immense
numbers in the same autumn, has been almost entirely
absent. About half a dozen are recorded at Heligoland, none on
the East Coast of England.</p>

<p>The intermittent migration of some birds, as the Jay, Shore
Lark, Goldcrest, Hedgesparrow, Siskin, and Mealy Redpole,
indicated by their extraordinary abundance in some years, and
partial or entire absence in others, is perhaps suggestive of local
causes influencing and regulating their movements, such as a
succession of favourable breeding seasons, scarcity or failure of
food, sudden meteorological changes; these acting separately or in
combination, would be sufficient to compel the migration of large
bodies of birds from centres or localities, where, under normal
conditions, they would either have remained or some part only
migrated. In this manner whole districts may become denuded
for a time of their feathered inhabitants, and the balance become
again rectified by a return movement in the spring, or from the
surplus supply bred in other districts.</p>

<p>Of the enormous immigration which crosses our east coast in
the autumn, either to winter in these islands or passing across
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">-62-</span>
them, a small proportion only appear to return by the same
route. Spring returns from lighthouses and light-vessels show
birds then move on the same lines as were followed in the
autumn, but in the reverse direction. Yet these return travellers
do not represent anything like a tithe of the immigrants which,
week by week and month after month in the autumn, pour in one
great tide on to the coast.</p>

<p>What is called the "first flight" of the Woodcock arrived on
the Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Norfolk coasts on the night of
Oct. 21st. The "great flight" or rush, which covered the whole
of the east coast from the Farn Islands to Yarmouth, was on the
nights of the 28th and 29th. These two periods correlate with
the great flights of Woodcocks over Heligoland.</p>

<p>We are again indebted to Professor Ch. F. L&uuml;tken, of Copenhagen,
for a list of the birds killed or taken alive against the
lantern of the Stevns lighthouse, at the entrance of the Oresund,
in Zealand. The list is specially interesting, as it names so
many of the Heligoland birds. The occurrence of Locustella
fluviatilis on Sept. 5th is the first recorded example for Denmark.</p>

<p>The Roller, <i>Coracias garrula</i>, occurred in October in two
localities, one in Lincolnshire, the other in Suffolk. Two
examples of the Sooty Shearwater, <i>Puffinus griseus</i>, were
obtained in Bridlington Bay in the end of September. Altogether
there has been a very marked absence along our east coast of
rare and casual visitants; Heligoland, however, retains its pre-eminence
for rare wanderers, and Mr. G&auml;tke's list for 1883
includes <i>Turdus varius</i>, <i>Pratincola rubicola</i> var. <i>indicus</i>,
<i>Phylloscopus superciliosus</i>, <i>Hypolais pallida</i>, <i>Motacilla citriola</i>, <i>Anthus
cervinus</i>, <i>A. richardi</i>, <i>Oriolus galbula</i>, <i>Lanius major</i>, <i>Muscicapa
parva</i>, <i>Linota exilipes</i>, <i>Emberiza melanocephala</i>, <i>E. cirlus</i>, <i>E.
rustica</i>, <i>E. pusilla</i>, <i>Pastor roseus</i>, and <i>Xema Sabinii</i>.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;At page 47, under the head "<i>Coracias garrula</i>, Roller,"
the locality of Bradwell is erroneously given in Norfolk, instead
of Suffolk (2&frac12; miles S.W. of Great Yarmouth). Mr. Gurney
writes that, on June 6th, 1884, a Roller was shot at Gresham,
near Cromer, and that before this Norfolk has not produced one
for about thirty years.</p>

<p class="caption3nb smcap">General Remarks by Reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. James Youngclause, Monach lighthouse, says:&mdash;"I am
sorry to have such a meagre report to send you, but birds have
been awfully scarce here for some years back, and I have sent
you records of all that I have seen."</p>

<p>I am obliged to Mr. William Irvine for the first report I have
received from Barra Head, which, however, is a station which
can hardly be expected to give large returns, owing to its position
and great height above the sea. A daily record here for a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">-65-</span>
seasons of the movements of Gannets and rock-birds might prove
of considerable interest, such as daily hours of going to and from
their feeding-grounds. Such might be found also interesting to
fisherfolk.</p>

<p>Mr. James Ewing, of Dhuheartach, says of the spring migration
and the long-continued east winds:&mdash;"A few Larks in March,
and some Stonechats in the first days of April, are all that we have
seen of the spring migration. I am convinced that a change of wind
happening during the migratory season tends more to lead the birds
astray than strong breezes. It will be interesting to note if there
is any increase during this autumn, as our light, which was red
towards Mull, has been changed to a white occulting light."</p>

<p>By the autumn schedules migration appears to have quite
ceased here by date of Dec. 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. W. M'Lellan speaks of the great scarcity of shore-birds, as
compared with other seasons. Where Curlews were seen daily in
past years only one was seen this year. Season very open and mild.</p>

<p>Mr. Alex. Murray, Lismore, writes:&mdash;"During the last five
nights of October we had the largest number of birds that I have
seen for a long time, and especially Gold-crested Wrens; but since
that time up to date (8th Jan. 1884) there has been little of note."</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lyall says, "Very few birds at Rhinns of Islay
this season, and not many striking." But the rush at end of
October and beginning of November was very marked.</p>

<p>Mr. David Waters has few night records to chronicle, most of
his observations being made during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. James Begg, Port Patrick, writes:&mdash;"Flocks of migrants
very scarce this winter. Great many sea-gulls flying inland and
coming back to sea daily. The Gannets commence to go south
and return north in flight past this station from March to
September in great numbers."</p>

<p>Mr. William Wither sends a light schedule from Storr Head,
and speaks of the general scarcity of birds there, but at a locality
a little more inland birds are plentiful in summer and autumn,
and Mr. M'Ivor, teacher there, has kindly offered to keep land-notes
another year.</p>

<p>Although so light at Dhuheartach, a considerable migration
observed at Skerryvore both in spring and autumn. On Oct. 30th
(the date of the universal rush of Thrushes, &amp;c.) Mr. William
Crow saw three Bullfinches on the rock, wind S., fresh, and fog,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span>
and captured one of them with little difficulty. "It appeared
quite tame, I approaching it within four feet. We placed a spare
cage we had, with some linseed, within six feet of it. The bird
went in at once, and is still alive. It drank fresh water to
excess after being caught, and was ill all next day. It revived
afterwards, and is doing well."</p>

<p>From Turnberry lighthouse there is no return, but Mr. Andrew
writes, birds were scarcer than usual. But as this is a station
where there is usually some migration discernible he hopes to
send returns in future. Like others of our reporters, he naturally
complains of his difficulty about the names of the birds; but if
he will only enter such as he is sure of, and send me the head
and wings of others, or even the wings alone, and by attaching
a bit of cardboard and a number to them, and a corresponding
number in the schedule instead of a name, I could in most cases
be able to identify them.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> A general request to this effect will be found in our latest issue of
Letters of Instruction.</p>

</div>

<p>From Cape Wrath lighthouse comes the following P.C.:&mdash;"There
are no land-birds at this station, with the exception of
Grouse. The same schedule will apply every year for the sea-birds,
as they come and go within a week of the same time.
Eight years' experience." I may just once more try to explain
that it is exactly this week of difference in time, one year with
another, which the Committee desire to collect statistics about
as regards sea-fowl and rock-birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The spring migration on the West Coast seems
almost to have escaped notice. At Stornoway Thrushes were
heard on Feb. 19th and 20th, and heard and seen on the 27th,
but these may have been residents.</p>

<p>The autumn migration, however, is almost as marked as on
the East Coast, the time and extent agreeing, though numerically,
as might be expected, not so great. Extent as follows:&mdash;Stornoway
in the north (light), Island Glass (indication), Monach (do.),
Barra Head (considerable), and on the mainland and Inner
Hebrides from Kyleakin (light), Skerryvore (distinct and considerable),
Dhuheartach (light), Sound of Mull (indication),
M'Arthur's Head (a few), Rhinns of Islay.(a few), Skervuile (a
few), Lamlash (light), Corsewall (heavy), Loch Ryan (considerable).
The above remarks apply principally to Blackbirds and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span>
Song Thrushes, but Fieldfares and "Mountain" Thrushes are
once or twice mentioned, and one Water Ouzel was caught at
Skervuile on Sept. 13th.</p>

<p>The time occupied was as follows:&mdash;Earliest record in
autumn, Sept. 23rd, one Thrush on lantern at Lamlash; may
have been local. Next, 1st and 7th and 8th, a few scattered
records at Barra Head, and between Dhuheartach and Lismore.
About Oct. 23rd greater numbers, but nothing very remarkable
till Oct. 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, and Nov. 1st to 3rd or 4th,
when the rush took place. Movements continued up to end of
November, but not large numerically, and nothing more that
could be called a rush. A considerable number were killed at
Skerryvore at the height of the rush on 28th, 29th and 30th;
eight Thrushes on first date, thirty-six on 29th, and thirteen on
30th. Blackbirds and Thrushes about in equal proportion of
records, but Thrushes bulking largest numerically. Species
included are Song Thrush (max.). Blackbirds (large numbers),
Fieldfares, and one Dipper or Water Ouzel at Skervuile.
Thrushes of sorts quite absent during a rush of other species at
Kyleakin, and throughout the season. Five species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wheatears.&mdash;In spring, appearance of a rush at
Skerryvore on April 20th and 21st, fifty seen during the day on
former date and twelve on latter; and on April 8th a single bird
at Dhuheartach. A great many at Skervuile on May 5th, and
on 15th four seen at Butt of Lewis.</p>

<p>In autumn, extent, from Stornoway (Oct.), Skerryvore (Aug),
Dhuheartach (Sept. and Oct.), Lismore (Aug.). Redstarts.&mdash;Skervuile
(Sept.), Corsewall (Aug.). Earliest, Aug. 24th, at
Skerryvore. Latest, Oct. 29th, at Dhuheartach. Rush of Redstarts
all night at Lismore. The above remarks apply in all
cases to Wheatears (or so-called "Stonechats"), except where
otherwise specified. Numbers at Stornoway with Linnets in
Oct. Considered rare here by reporter.</p>

<p>Prevailing winds in spring, E. through S.E. and S.S.E. to S.,
and variable on April 8th at Dhuheartach. Two species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Robin.&mdash;No spring records. Autumn, Robin, Kyleakin;
Stornoway, isolated examples during December; Lismore,
on Nov. 11th, with Wrens and Linnets, and a few single
records in September and October; Dhuheartach, few; Lamlash
and Corsewall, single records, and Robins accompanying rush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span>
of other species on Aug. 28th and 29th. At Kyleakin, Robins
arrived on Nov. 15th and remained all winter. Prevailing winds,
W. and northerly, very rarely easterly or S.E. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Goldcrest.&mdash;No spring records. Autumn,
slight indications and single records as far north as Dhuheartach;
one at midnight on Nov. 7th, light W., haze. Then again at
Lismore, Oct. 31st, light S. airs, along with Larks; Skervuile,
few, Nov. 1st, light S. wind; Lamlash, one; Corsewall, great
numbers, or rush, on Aug. 30th, heralded by one single bird the
day before. Loch Ryan, four on Oct. 30th. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentor.</span>&mdash;Hedgesparrow.&mdash;A number seen in the garden at
Lamlash on Nov. 21st, during stormy weather. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Two Titmice struck at Sound of Mull, in light W.
breeze, not killed, on Oct. 30th. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring, at Corsewall six struck, none killed,
on 28th, and five rested at same place on 29th; wind light E.
and haze both nights.</p>

<p>In autumn a few records at Dhuheartach, Sound of Mull,
M'Arthur's Head, Lamlash, Corsewall, and Loch Ryan. Earliest,
Oct. 3rd; latest, Nov. 30th; all single birds, or very light
returns. Winds, N.W. or N.N.W., except on Nov. 6th, at Lamlash,
when wind was N.E. and weather fine. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, at Kyleakin (earliest March 20th,
when two seen flying S.! light E., clear), Skerryvore, Dhuheartach,
and Skervuile. Latest at Kyleakin on May 17th, when
two seen on garden wall. Largest number, four, at Dhuheartach,
rested on April 20th, and flew towards Isle of Colonsay. Records
relate always to "Wagtails."</p>

<p>In autumn, at stations:&mdash;Barra Head (several had been there
for a month on Aug. 27th), Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, M'Arthur's
Head (only record a flock on Nov. 5th, with N.W. gale and sleet),
Rhinns of Islay (first and only record on Nov. 4th, a single bird,
with W. gale), Lamlash (three on Sept. 22nd, and two on Nov.
12th, the latest record, winds westerly). One ? species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Single spring record, one Titlark, at Lamlash,
rested on lantern on May 2nd.</p>

<p>In autumn, one at Skerryvore rested on rocks on Aug. 24th,
light W., haze, and <i>a number</i> at Lamlash on Oct. 6th, and a few
on 30th, being all the records. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records in April; earliest at Loch Ryan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">-69-</span>
on 15th, when thirty arrived,&mdash;see autumn under September,&mdash;May,
June; latest June 15th, two flying S. at Kyleakin, or, if we
take July, three at Barra Head on 8th; remained all day, wind
var. to S.E. by evening. Greatest number of records in May.
Stations:&mdash;Barra Head (Sand Martins), Kyleakin, Skerryvore,
Lismore, Rhinns of Islay, Lamlash, and Corsewall. The following
are first arrivals:&mdash;Barra Head (Sand Martins), May 1st, two,
fresh S.E., clear; Lamlash, May 1st; Corsewall, May 2nd; Loch
Ryan, April 15th. All records above apply to Chimney Swallows,
save in the two instances of Sand Martins.</p>

<p>In autumn records light also on the whole coast. Dhuheartach,
Lismore, and Loch Ryan. Earliest, and rush, Aug. 19th,
at Dhuheartach, large flock of old and young flying S., and at
Lismore, one seen flying S. On Sept. 23rd twenty Swallows left
Loch Ryan, and on 28th the remaining ten (see spring, <i>supra</i>);
winds westerly and N.W. Three species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring:&mdash;At Butt of Lewis, four Tree Sparrows
on April 14th, light S.W. wind; and Sparrows, a large flock
flying south, light E., haze. Also Sparrows at M'Arthur's Head,
a number on May 12th. Of Linnets, many after gale of April
17th, at M'Arthur's Head, a flock at Lismore on June 21st, and
one bird at Skerryvore on June 25th. A single Goldfinch at
Lismore, on 21st, with the Linnets.</p>

<p>In autumn:&mdash;Earliest July 28th, a very large flock of Sparrows
flying S.E., at Butt of Lewis, and none again till Sept. 4th, when
a number of Linnets remained about till the 9th. Latest record
Oct. 30th, participated in rush of other species, but on Dec. 15th
a rush of "small birds" is recorded at several stations. Greatest
numbers in October, at Stornoway, Skerryvore (a Bullfinch,
see light-keeper's remarks, <i>antea</i>), Lismore (good many),
M'Arthur's Head, Lamlash. It is difficult to fix dates of rushes,
but one great rush took place on Sept. 15th, of Linnets and
Sparrows at M'Arthur's Head, and indicated at Lamlash by ten
Linnets flying south. These notes are given of Linnets and
Grey Linnets, also on Oct. 30th, at Lismore, of Green and Grey
Linnets, a number at Priory Farm. Numerous instances of
direction of flight are given, usually "flying S." We have
received considerably more statistics this year of these important
<i>directions of flight</i>. We wish our reporters could distinguish
between Common Linnets, Green Linnets, and Twites or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">-70-</span>
Mountain Linnets, always when possible. Linnets have travelled
in company with Wheatears at Stornoway, and with Thrushes
and Curlews (the latter several times). About seven species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Snow Bunting. Very scanty records on W.
coast. At Stornoway one, first seen on Oct. 17th, and twenty
on 18th. At Lismore twenty on Oct. 22nd. At Rhinns of Islay
one on Nov. 5th, and in December no records, and in January a
few at Butt of Lewis on 26th, and strong W. and sleet. Prevailing
winds W., strong to gales, but mod. N. at Rhinns of
Islay on Nov. 5th. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring at Skerryvore, earliest Feb. 10th, four
struck, two killed, strong S.W.; and in March, at same place,
on 10th, nine struck and three were killed, fresh N. and showers.</p>

<p>In autumn, at Dhuheartach, earliest on Sept. 10th, a few,
and on 29th three; wind N.N.E., clear. Also, furthest north,
records at Butt of Lewis, Stornoway, and so south by Skerryvore,
Dhuheartach, Skervuile, and Rhinns of Islay. Latest at
Stornoway, small numbers on 24th. Greatest movements in
October at Butt of Lewis, on 11th, large numbers flying south;
and at Stornoway 19th, 20th, and 23rd; on latter date with
Thrushes and one Redbreast. Prevailing winds, northerly and
westerly. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Starlings feed all through the month of April at
Butt of Lewis.</p>

<p>Autumn records scarce. Regular daily at Rhinns of Islay
all August. No records anywhere given in September. [We
trust our reporters bear in mind that we desire movements of
even our commonest species, and especially directions of flight.]
In October a few records from Butt of Lewis, two killed, but
Mr. Thompson considers these part of the residents; also at
M'Arthur's Head and Lamlash. If any rush it was on Oct.
30th, and also 29th, when it was noticed at Island Ghlais<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and
at Rhinns of Islay; but the movement appears to have been
insignificant. I have a single record in November from Monach
Island, and one of a flock in December at Loch Ryan. One species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Ghlais or Glass: both spellings used.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Jackdaws, Crows, Black Grows, Grey Crows,
Ravens, and one of Magpie, the latter at Kyleakin, marked "very
rare," on Jan. 7th, flying S.E. Stations are Skerryvore, Dhuheartach
in spring; and Rhu Stoir, where Crows (are these Rooks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span>
or Carrion Crows?) feed every day till 31st (I suspect these are
local Rooks from Cama Loch, but would like to know for certain).
Only some ten records in all&mdash;February, March, April, May,
June; and August, September, October (Ravens at Kyleakin),

<p>There is only one record of Whimbrel under the name "The
Small Curlew," when two were seen at Skerryvore flying about
the rocks. I wish we could more exactly trace the lines of
migration of the Whimbrel, or "May fowl" of the Hebrides, in
both spring and autumn (see remarks of Mr. D. Gray in the

16th. The first came with a fresh S. breeze and rain. At
Corsewall first observed was on May 11th.</p>

<p>In autumn. Terns, as already stated, left Stornoway in
August, but "about ten days later than usual." The last seen
at Skervuile was on Sept. 6th. At Sound of Mull, on Sept. 30th,
a flock rested for two hours, and then flew away S.E., composed
of old and young together. Moderate wind.</p>

Barra Head, numbers seen of same, and Puffins, on April 27th;
light S.E. wind. A few Puffins seen on May 1st; and fresh
N.E. A great many more on May 2nd; fresh N.E. At Butt
of Lewis, first Razorbills seen on April 25th.</p>

<p>In autumn, Marrots leave Barra Head Aug. 12th, along with
the bulk of Razorbills, but Puffins not till Aug. 25th. Marrots
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">-76-</span>
and Razorbills left with fresh E. wind. Puffins left in fresh
S. wind.</p>

<p>Cormorants arrived about same time as Razorbills and
Aleid&aelig;, but remain about six weeks later at Butt of Lewis; and
at Kyleakin there is record of a flock of twenty-eight flying W.
on 13th, with S.W. breeze. Four species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colymbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;On June 10th one great N. Diver seen swimming
near Lighthouse, at Kyleakin, moving N. (but this movement
may be due to set of the tide only, hour not given,
J. A. H. B.). In autumn, at Sound of Mull, a G. N. D., passing
S., var., light breezes. At Lismore, one flying south; stormy W.,
rain, on Oct. 17th. At Sound of Mull, two passing south, at
noon; light airs. If the movement is only local and due to
tides, this should be mentioned in schedules, and the words
"drifting with tide," or "swimming with tide," used instead of
"passing." They are not likely to swim against the tide, but if
this phenomenon is observed it should be recorded. One species.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Weather Notes for General Remarks on Spring
Migration, 1883.</span></p>

<p>Fearful snow-storm over the north of Shetland on March
17th, and N.E. gales and snow prevailed from March 5th to
24th; E. and N.E. and N. winds prevailed all over Scotland with
gales, notably on March 6th and 17th; from 6th to 24th slight
changes to S.E., but of short duration; on 25th (Sunday) wind
S.W. strong to gale and rain, the first rain since February, but
only lasted half a day; wind backed again to N.E. In Orkney
the sea rose suddenly very high on the E. coast on March 21st;
very cold and fine on 22nd, wind light S.W. "Large quantities
of Cormorants, Razorbills, and Shags, &amp;c., are coming ashore
along the E. coast of Orkney. Deaths supposed to be from
scarcity of food, <i>viz.</i>, coal-fish; and great damage done to
rabbits by Hawks, in some cases nearly exterminating them
(daily papers of March 23rd, 1883). At Dunipace 12&deg; of frost on
night of March 27th. Fearful gale at 9 a.m. on March 30th, bar.
at 28&#8242; 9&#8243;; gale all night from S.W., bar. rising all day; again
till 9 p.m. to 29&#8242; 6&#8243;, wind S.W. at 10 p.m.; again at 30&#8242; 2&#8243;. S.
gale at Isle of May on March 29th and 30th.</p>

<p>As already mentioned in our General Remarks on 1882
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span>
Report (Fourth Report, 1882, p. 67) the effects of these gales
and N.E. winds in spring of 1883 was almost to stop migration
at Isle of May, which migration had "set in pretty briskly"
on March 2nd, and almost ceased on the 5th. From the latter
date only a few "stragglers of the strongest wings" up to the
19th; while a great concourse of Wagtails was observed inland in
Edinburgh (see report as above quoted); few were seen at Isle of
May till the 30th, when five came with S. gale (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 68).</p>

<p>The general migration was much weaker in numbers this
season in spring, and this is doubtless owing to the prevalence of
strong S.E. gales and winds at the time of migration, moderate
S.E. or easterly winds being preferred. Still there were considerable
rushes at the more favourable localities for observation
especially of Thrushes and other <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The anomalous migration recorded by Mr. Cordeaux on to part
of the English coast between Feb. 18th and May 18th,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> with
strong E. and S.E. winds, changing occasionally by N.E. to W.
and N.W., is somewhat difficult of explanation, unless we could
correlate data from the opposite coasts at the same dates in
spring of 1883; but the fact stated by me that migration began
briskly at Isle of May on March 2nd and almost ceased by the
5th may indicate that the migration thus retarded by adverse
winds, or altered in direction thereby, passed N. by more inland
routes, avoiding the Scottish coast-line, and hugging every
sheltering hollow of land. Blown across the North Sea at the
more southerly stations, they then crept northwards silently and
more inland. Being all adult birds, and having crossed the
North Sea not at the widest part if they came with a S.E. wind,
less exhaustion would occur, and thus, passing inland, they would
escape notice near the coast.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> See <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a> of this Report.</p>

</div>

<p>Before we can speak with much certainty as to the progress
of spring migrations into the further districts influenced by them,
we require more full and continuous data from Faroe and Iceland.
Still, the earliest appearance noted in Iceland of the Redwing,
<i>Turdus iliacus</i>, on April 7th, 1882, should be noted as a possible
means of comparison in that year with the returns from our own
coasts. Data from our West Coast of Scotland help us little in
1883 in spring, and even less so in 1882, as regards <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>.
Wheatears again, in 1882, are noted not before April 24th, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span>
on West Coast of Scotland the migration, though but scantily
observed, began on March 9th and terminated as late as May
17th (see 1882 Report, p. 57).</p>

<p>The autumn migration of 1883 was pronounced, and confined
principally to end of October and November, of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, <i>Cinclid&aelig;</i>
(one of which, seen at Isle of May, was afterwards described to
me as having no brown between the black and white of the
breast); also of Snow Buntings, Sky Larks, Robins (small
numbers), Linnets, Chaffinches, Starlings, culminating in a grand
rush past of the bulk between Oct. 28th or 30th and Nov. 3rd.
The heaviest rush, observed at the time of a south wind, as
compared with other years, at Isle of May, was on Oct. 13th
and 14th, a S.E. wind, according to Mr. Agnew, being usually
more favourable at that point. This October to November rush
is undoubtedly the principal feature of our returns over the
whole country. Of the expansion of the fan or wave our returns
from both E. and W. coasts give a very fair indication. It seems
likely that, although most land-stations have not returned very
heavily-laden schedules,&mdash;not to compare, for instance, with
1882,&mdash;yet, as noticed by Mr. Cordeaux, quite as many, if not
more, birds were observed at the light-ships; that the reason for
this may be found in the normal and favourable direction of the
winds prevailing in the North Sea at the time of autumn
migration, resulting in greater numbers of birds passing inland
without resting, and being thus less liable to come under
observation, except at specially suitable stations. And, if we
/ compare the schedules of 1883 and those of 1882 on the West
Coast of Scotland we find that, while larger numbers are
recorded at the more northerly stations in 1883 than in 1882,
there is a lighter return at more southerly stations in the autumn
of 1883 than there was in the autumn of 1882. Thus to no inconsiderable
degree the order of the statistics of two years is
reversed. It would almost appear in this way that when a
"spread fan" reaches our E. coast with S.E. winds&mdash;reaching,
as it did in 1882, from Faroe S. to the English Channel&mdash;the
birds, being tired and worn out, promptly seek shelter, and then,
when rested, pursue their migration on more southerly lines, and
do not reach so far west, except such as fail to catch up the land,
and are driven forward helplessly. This would cause comparative
desertion of the more northerly stations of the W. coast and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span>
Outer Hebrides, as in 1882. But on the other hand, when a
"closed fan" reaches our E. coast with prevailing westerly and
north-westerly winds, and, having much less expansion to the
northward, as in 1883, as regards the E. coast, it seems that
birds arriving, less exhausted with the winds best suited for
their successful passage, pass on inland, the same lines of
flight being persevered in, and thus reach further north upon the
West Coast of Scotland.</p>

<p>Thus the Goldcrest, in 1883, reached as far north as Dhuheartach
and Lismore in some numbers; but in 1882, when
they came in such vast hordes to our east coast, we had no
records north of Rhinns of Islay, and none others until we found
them in "great numbers" at stations south of the Firth of
Clyde.</p>

<p>Rushes took place on August 16th at Isle of May, and again
on 22nd, with easterly wind and fog, principally of Wheatears,
culminating on night of Sept. 2nd-3rd, and being accompanied
by Redstarts, Chiffchaffs, Robins, Sedge Warblers, Wood Warblers,
and Golden and Grey Plovers; Thrushes apparently totally absent.
A single adult Blue-throated Warbler, with bright blue breast,
was observed at Isle of May. The rush was on Sept. 4th, at
Pentland Skerries, with strong N. wind. Another rush, about
Sept. 15th, of Willow Warblers and Chiffchaffs; and, on 22nd, of
Robins, accompanied by a single recorded Goldcrest. A rush of
the latter took place on Oct. 10th at Isle of May. Common
Wrens, not in large numbers, also migrated on Sept. 22nd and
23rd.</p>

<p>Another feature of the 1883 Report is the abundance of
Finches, which usually travel with the Thrushes, but whose
migration appears to be extended over a longer period of time
than that of the Thrushes in 1883.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from the Report that the dates of rushes
on our E. Scottish coasts were slightly later than those on the
E. English coast, averaging from twenty-four to thirty hours by
the schedules, and that the migration past the more northerly
stations of Scotland were in proportion later than in the south.
And also that the dates of the heaviest rushes on the E. coast
agree fairly well with the dates of the W. coast.</p>

<p>While closing our 1883 Report it is perhaps desirable to call
attention to the very great spring migration of Woodcocks, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">-80-</span>
appears to have crossed Scotland between Clyde and Forth on
March 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, 1884. On the 10th our covers
here (Dunipace) were full of Woodcock. Torwood also held
large numbers on 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th; at Glenbervie, close
to this, also unusual numbers were observed. From the Ayrshire
coast they are reported numerous, but not more so than usual at
this season, indicating that the Ayrshire coast, or properties
along the coast, are usually visited in the spring migration. At
Fassaroe, Bray, Co. Wicklow, Mr. Barrington made enquiries,
but no extraordinary numbers have been noted there. At
Islay Mr. Ballingall reports unusual numbers about the time
mentioned.</p>

<p>At Ross Priory, east side of Loch Lomond, a good many
were observed, there being snow on the ground at the time; but
at Arden, on the west side, and almost immediately opposite, no
additions were observed. At Aberfoyle and neighbourhood very
large numbers were observed. In East Kilbryde Parish, to the
south of Forth and Clyde isthmus, two were seen at a locality where
none were ever seen before. At Callander no unusual number was
noticed, a good many appearing here at this season, which is usually
called "The Return of the Woodcocks." Mr. Robert Ferguson,
on the 11th, flushed eight within a mile-radius, "a most unusual
circumstance here,"&mdash;at Whitehill, Rosewell, Midlothian,&mdash;and
large numbers were observed near Innerleithen in Holylee
Woods and vicinity. To the east of this county no numbers of
any consequence were noted at Tulliallan or West Grange, in
Fife.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> All the birds seen by myself were small red Scandinavian
birds, which I consider are quite unmistakable and distinct from
home-bred birds. One with an injured muscle under the wing
was brought into the house,&mdash;also a red bird,&mdash;which was found
alive in a ditch close to.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> Subsequently I received a note from Mr. Seton Thomson, of Kinnaird
House, Stirlingshire, to the effect that the gamekeeper, on March 1st, on
taking a bee-line to Airth, two and a half miles over moss-land (Airth is on
the Stirlingshire side of the Firth of Forth, where about three hundred yards
of water separate it from Tulliallan) put up half a dozen Woodcocks in a
place where Woodcocks are very rarely seen. Many also were seen about
the garden at Kinnaird House; these were observed not to be the usual
Woodcocks, but a much redder-looking bird. There appears to have been a
great flight of Woodcocks at Aberfoyle about March 15th. Mr. R. Ker's
keeper flushed five in about two square yards, and kept putting them up all
over. Two were seen also at Crutherland, by East Kilbryde, on the 12th,
where a Woodcock was never seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">-81-</span></p>

<p>I would like further to have ascertained the boundaries within
which this migration was observed; how far to the north and how
far to the south of the catchment Basin of Forth it extended.
Here I can do little more than direct attention to the facts, so
far as known to me. But it seems evident that, though so
abundantly observed at Airth and Kinnaird, scarcely any increase
was noticeable just across the Forth at Tulliallan or
West Grange, or in Fife; and though numerous at Ross Priory
and Loch Lomond on the east side, no increase was observed at
Arden and the west side of the loch. When the birds "lifted"
from Kinnaird and Airth, their next probable resting place would
be Norway or the continental coast, possibly Heligoland, as no
notice is taken of them in the 1884 spring returns from Isle of
May or Bell Rock. Nor does there appear to have been any
corresponding movement through the Pentland Firth.</p>



<p>I should like in this place to record the occurrence of the
Black Redstart in the following form. It is previously recorded
by me in the Proc. Royal Physical Society, Edinb. of April 23rd,
1884:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<p>In the spring of 1883 schedules were forwarded to forty-two
stations, Arklow North Light-ship having been added to those of
the previous year. Twenty-five replied.</p>

<p>In the autumn only thirty-five schedules were sent out, seven
having been omitted, <i>i.e.</i>, Mine Head, Wicklow Head, Lough
Swilly, Eagle Island East, Slyne Head South, Loop Head, and
Samphire Island. Thirty-four were returned, one station
sending no answer.</p>

<p>A decided improvement in filling the schedules occurred in
the autumn, the observations of some light-keepers extending
over three or even four schedules. The labour of arranging the
materials for this report and placing the entries under the head
of each species has consequently been much increased.</p>

<p>In addition to the schedules the light-keepers at Coningbeg
light-ship, Tuskar Rock, Rathlin Island, Killybegs, Tearaght,
and Skelligs have forwarded lists of all the birds they have
observed, whether migrating or otherwise. There is an evident
disposition on the part of all to help us as far as possible in this
enquiry. The light stations are arranged geographically&mdash;beginning
at the Fastnet, in Cork, and going' round by the east
to the west coast.</p>

<p>The number of migrants passing in the autumn seems to
have been greater than usual. A great rush of Thrushes (including
probably Redwings), Blackbirds, and Starlings, took place at our
south eastern and southern stations between Oct. 25th and Nov.
2nd&mdash;notably at the Tuskar, on the Wexford coast, which is the
best Irish station. Smaller rushes of these and other birds are
also recorded, but it is premature at present to analyse the movements
of each species or the dates on which they occurred.
After a few years conclusions will be far more satisfactory.</p>

<p>The great majority of birds are killed striking on foggy, misty,
or dark nights, and it is perhaps not impossible for a great
migration to take place, and pass almost unrecorded if the night
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">-83-</span>
be fine and bright. Whenever a bird has been killed striking, it
is so stated, and not left to be understood.</p>

<p>The bulk of the migrants appear to arrive on our south
eastern coast, except such birds as the Barnacle Goose and Snow
Bunting, which are mainly recorded from the north western
stations, being rarely entered in the schedules from the east or
south coasts.</p>

<p>An interesting feature this year is the occurrence of several
examples of the Greenland Falcon on the west coast.</p>

<p>The winter of 1883-4 was exceptionally mild, and the entries
due to local migration from frost and hard weather are probably
few.</p>

<p>Many entries no doubt refer to birds not migrating at all,
but none have been omitted, as it is difficult to know where to
draw the line. It is desirable, however, that the light-keepers
should state whether the bird is believed to be migrating or
merely moving about the district from local causes.</p>

<p>In the schedules for next year a special column for the direction
of flight has been added. This we think quite as important
as the direction of the wind. Birds seem rarely to fly directly
with the wind. Attention is drawn to this point in order to
have it confirmed or otherwise.</p>

<p>In order to diminish the errors in the identification of species
the light-keepers have been instructed to forward, when possible,
a leg and wing of every bird about which they are doubtful, and
we trust they will do so.</p>

<p>Some entries seem very improbable, and others are isolated
and apparently valueless. When records accumulate, both may
prove useful.</p>

<p>In addition to the little Skellig Rock&mdash;off the coast of Kerry&mdash;the
Gannet also breeds on the Bull Rock fifteen miles further
south, and a few are also reported as breeding in the Cow Rock
quite close to it.</p>

<p>No matter what results are arrived at from this enquiry, it
is satisfactory to be in correspondence with a number of observers
on isolated points all around the coast.</p>

<p>The information supplied, if corroborated during several years
by different light-keepers, cannot but be valuable, and we wish to
impress on them the necessity of continuing to assist in this
investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span></p>

<p>To all the light-keepers who have given their time and
attention to the subject we return our sincere thanks, especially
as their assistance is voluntary and given solely for the advancement
of knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong, Secretary to the Irish Lights Board, and
Captain Boxer, R.N., Inspector of Irish Lights, have helped us
in many ways by their advice and co-operation. The Commissioners
of Irish Lights have given us every facility, and also
material support by subscribing for forty copies of the report
and distributing them among the light-keepers.</p>

<p><i>Fastnet.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: On the night of Nov. 2nd, the weather
being hazy, there was a quantity of all species of birds came
from the N.E., and several of them were killed by striking the
lantern; but what was most remarkable was the quantity of
large Moths, which I could compare to nothing but a heavy fall
of snow, they were so numerous. In bad weather a few Seals
frequent the rock, and a quantity of Gulls and Sea Parrots&mdash;the
latter I have frequently seen killed and eaten by the Royal Gull.
The Gannet is here all the year. No birds breed. On Nov.
2nd, from one a.m. to seven a.m., there were killed by striking
the lantern twenty-two Thrushes, eleven Blackbirds, four Woodcocks,
seventeen Starlings, eight Linnets, five Larks, and seven
Robins. Wind S.E., light, hazy."&mdash;James Walsh.</p>

<p><i>Galley Head.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The flight of the Gannet and Puffin
is always to the west here. I have many times thought they
must pass east by some other route. The Grey-backed Crow
and Common Crow are seen all the year round. The Wagtail,
Stonechat, and other small birds have almost disappeared this
year. The Cuckoo I have not seen or heard this year. I have
never been at a station with less birds about than this one. I
am four years here, and there has not been one case of a bird
striking the lantern."&mdash;John Whelan.</p>

<p>"Autumn: I arrived at this station Nov. 6th, and from
that date to the present from ninety to one hundred Sea
Gulls are to be seen daily flying about the cliffs near the
Lighthouse. No birds of any other species have been seen
passing."&mdash;John Kelly. Feb., 1884.</p>

<p><i>Old Head, Kinsale.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: I have only seen some small
birds, such as Larks and Chaffinches, from Dec. 17th to Jan. 1st,
1884. There are Sea Gulls, Rooks, and Grey Crows seen here
all the year round, also two Falcon Hawks. Starlings commenced
to leave here the last week of November. Larks, Wrens,
Titmice, and Twite Linnets are seen all the year round, and on
the lake, three miles distant, large Duck, Widgeon, Coot, and
Waterhens. On Dec. 15th I saw a large flight of birds going to
the south at a great height, and suspect they were Golden Plover.
The Curlew never leaves the marsh three miles from here. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">-87-</span>
never saw less birds than there is this winter."&mdash;Martin
Kennedy.</p>

<p><i>Coningbeg Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: A great quantity of birds
passed this station last month. I have not seen so many birds
killed since I came to this station three years ago."&mdash;Patrick
Cullen. Nov., 1883.</p>

<p><i>Barrels Rock Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"Spring: I have observed very
few land birds passing this year, and none about the ship in
foggy weather, like other stations I have been at."</p>

<p><i>Tuskar Rock.</i>&mdash;"Spring: A great absence of sea fowl this
year. I consider it owing to the scarcity of fish."</p>

<p><i>Arklow North Light-ship.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: As a rule all birds
give the ship a wide berth when passing, and it is very hard to
tell what they are. During thick foggy nights a large quantity
of small land birds are killed striking our lantern."&mdash;William
Daly.</p>

<p><i>Copeland Island.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: A number of sea birds of
different species resort to this locality in the autumn and winter
months for feeding purposes, and are seen in greater or lesser
numbers each day as the weather suits and feeding is plentiful.
They are Gannets, Cormorants, Puffins, Grey and Royal Gulls,
Sea-pies, 'Cranes,' Ducks, Teal, Curlew, and Sandpipers. None
of these breed in the vicinity. On Oct. 10th a rush of Larks,
Starlings, Linnets, Titmice, Thrushes, Blackbirds, 'Grey' Plover,
and Snipe. Eighteen Starlings, six Blackbirds, twenty Larks,
twelve Linnets, eight Titmice, four Thrushes, three Plover, and
two Snipe killed striking lantern, and several injured but not
killed."&mdash;John Walsh.</p>

<p><i>South Maidens.</i>&mdash;"Spring: No birds strike the lantern in
April and May. They do not strike until October. Twelve
Gannets, twenty-four Ducks, six Sea-pies, and twelve Wild Geese
are all the birds I have seen for three months."&mdash;Patrick Keenan.&mdash;"Autumn:
I arrived here Sept. 25th, 1883, and saw no birds
up to Oct. 15th, save Puffins, Sea Gulls, and Cormorants, and
Sand Larks occasionally. Thrushes, Blackbirds, and Larks are
rarely seen. Wild Duck do not strike the lantern glass."&mdash;Michael Barry.</p>

<p><i>Rathlin Island.</i>&mdash;"April 12th: Blackbirds, Thrushes, Skylarks,
Wild Ducks, Redshanks, Pigeons, and 'Sea Coot' seem to
remain for the season. Autumn: I have never at any time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">-88-</span>
during the migratory season for Ducks, Widgeon, Wild Geese,
Barnacles, and Swan heard them passing at night as at other
stations."&mdash;John A. Murray.</p>

<p><i>Innishtrahull.</i>&mdash;"April 30th. A small bird with an orange
tail, name unknown, struck, not killed." Wind S.W.; a gale.
"Very little birds visited this island in May, June, and July,
except a flock of Curlew." Autumn: "There has been a great
absence of birds this winter, and no Snipe or Woodcock visited
this place. Snow Buntings remained here all the past winter."</p>

<p><i>Dunree Head.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: No birds resort to this station only
Cormorants, which remain all the year and breed. I have been
at several stations on the coast, but never was at a station so
scarce of birds as this."&mdash;John Stapleton.</p>

<p><i>Tory Island.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Very few birds past this station.
I suppose owing to its being so far out to sea. I am informed
that birds pass more frequently the east side of the island. On
the islands between this and the mainland large flocks of Barnacle
stop during the winter months. I have not seen a Snow Bunting,
Snipe, or Starling this season. During heavy frost, snow-birds
frequent the island from the mainland, but return as soon as
the thaw commences."&mdash;Thomas H. Sweeny.</p>

<p><i>Arranmore.</i>&mdash;"Spring: Gulls and Puffins have laid great
quantities of their eggs this year on the rock. A great many
have been destroyed by the Grey Crow."&mdash;Henry Williams.</p>

<p><i>Killybegs.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: The birds which breed around here
are the Wild Duck, Wild Pigeon, Lapwing, Lark, Linnet,
Swallow, Snipe, Common Wren, Thrush, Robin, Blackbird,
Sparrow, Stonechat, Sand Lark, and Grey Crow."&mdash;Daniel
Hawkins.</p>

<p><i>Broadhaven.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: No birds strike this light."&mdash;Patrick Keenan.</p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, East.</i>&mdash;"Since I joined this station in Sept.,
1882, up to present date, Sept., 1883, nothing worth noting."&mdash;H. Stocker.</p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, West.</i>&mdash;"There was absolutely nothing of
interest to enter in schedule last autumn-. The sea has been
crossing this island, I may say daily, for the last five months,
and with the exception of a few Sea Gulls, which seem never to
leave the locality, there were no birds visited." March, 1884.&mdash;Matthew Healy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">-89-</span></p>

<p><i>Blacksod.</i>&mdash;"I have carefully looked out for birds, and seen
none worth entering. I have seen several seals."&mdash;Robert W.
Redmond.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;"In February very few birds are seen at this
station. No birds strike this lantern. A great number of seals
frequent this place in caves round the cliffs."&mdash;George H.
Brownell.</p>

<p><i>Slyne Head, North.</i>&mdash;"Spring: I beg to remark that at all
times sea birds are to be seen on this coast, their numbers being
chiefly regulated by the feeding for them."&mdash;Robert Tyrrell.</p>

<p><i>Arran Island, North.</i>&mdash;"During the months of January and
February no birds are seen except a few Sea-pies and Sand-larks.
It must be in consequence of the very wild and stormy
weather."&mdash;Thomas Fortune.</p>

<p><i>Straw Island.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The different species of sea fowl
are very scarce this season. I believe from the want of small
fry. None breed on this island, it being low and flat.
Autumn: Birds scarcely ever strike the lantern in consequence
of the light appearing in a different direction to the general
flight of birds, being also a red light. It is 26 feet above high
water, and ten miles from land. I have remarked a greater
number of Blackbirds and Starlings this winter than since the
great frost of 1880. On Oct. 28th a flock of Wild Duck alighted,
apparently much exhausted, and remained a few hours, and went
S.E., towards land."&mdash;Charles Boyle.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;July 30th. "The following birds are still on the
island, <i>viz.</i>, Guillemots, Sea Parrots, Kittiwakes, Grey Crows,
Sea-pies, Razorbills, Manx Shearwater, Stonechats, and, I think.
Choughs and Falcons (Blue Hawks). All these breed on the
island. Dec. 18th, birds remaining: Grey Linnets, Rock
Pigeon, Thrushes, Mackerel Cock (on water). Blackbirds.
Residents, Titlarks and Common Wren. The 'Mackerel Cock'
is about the size of a Razorbill, but it is not the Razorbill.
Thousands of them are round the rock now. Feb. 2nd, 1884."
(See under Manx Shearwater).</p>

<p><i>Dursey Island.</i>&mdash;"The Gannet breed on the Bull Rock,
several hundred. On the Cow Rock, distant three-quarters of a
mile from the Bull, a few also breed. I believe the Gannet did
not breed on the Bull until after the Skellig light was erected."
[This was in 1826. R. M. B.]&mdash;Michael Shea. "Very few birds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">-90-</span>
breed on this island, except the Wild Pigeon, Jackdaw, and a few
Sea Gulls. On the Bull Rock, four miles N.W. of Dursey Head,
the Gannet and Puffin breed in great numbers, coming about
March 1st and leaving Oct. 1st."&mdash;James Keenan.</p>


<p class="caption4nb smcap">Eagle.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;"The Eagles still inhabit the cliffs, and have
been as usual destructive to young lambs and fowls belonging
to the inhabitants. In December they make very bold, and not
having sea birds to feed on, are often observed near the villages,
principally when the wind is east."</p>

<p>[This has been an extraordinary year for the occurrence of

before they come on the island; then they mostly rise in one
body, and hover some time before they rest. They all go down to
the water again when getting dark, except when breeding; those
hatching remain. As a rule there is a rush to the island every
day about 4 p.m. Sometimes there are two rushes in the day.
Their fighting propensities are often put into practice, and when
so engaged they can readily be captured; their fight only ends
when they have reached the sea, after having tumbled sometimes
all the way from the highest pinnacle of the island."</p>

May 1st. On May 24th only two eggs were found among
hundreds of nests. The nest-building is carried on by some
after hatching has commenced with others. A difficult business
this nest-making seems to be, as the mud or clay which makes
up the foundation has to be carried from some soft bank.
Hundreds of them are employed about six weeks at this
operation, some going with the very small portion of mud
they are able to take in their beaks, others coming for more,
the bank covered over with more in the act of digging out.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
